<p>The answer is yes, they can — but it doesn�t mean they should. Simply put, lactose can�t pass through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream very easily. Organic skim milk or milk with a 1% fat content is preferred. You can offer small amounts as a treat. We all have in our minds images from movies or cartoons of a hungry cat lapping with pleasure in small sips of milk. There are products out there that mimic milk and are safe for cats.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-try-this-one-from-petco-for-4841">You can try this one from petco for $48.41</h3><p>Cats are very fond of cream, which they value for its high fat content, and so they are especially attracted to milk that has come straight from the cow, especially after the cream has been allowed to rise to the top. The image of a cat happily lapping up milk is such a common one that many people don’t even question it. In fact, giving your cat too much soy milk can result in thyroid and liver problems in cats. If you do want to give your cat milk, you can buy specially formulated cat milk from most supermarkets or pet shops. Baby mammals, like kittens, produce enough lactase that they can digest their mother�s milk.but as they wean off of their mother�s milk—at four to six weeks of age, on average—and grow into adulthood, they begin to produce less lactase and lose the ability to properly digest milk. However, they still shouldn’t be given it regularly as cow’s milk adds an unhealthy amount of fat to a cat’s diet without any nutritional benefits.</p>

<p>We all have in our minds images from movies or cartoons of a hungry cat lapping with pleasure in small sips of milk. You can offer small amounts as a treat. Condensed milk is very, very sweet, which is not at all good for your cat. Cats love the taste of milk, be that soy milk or almond milk. Cats that aren’t lactose intolerant can be given a small amount of cow’s milk, but it’s still better to give them yogurt, kefir, or goat’s milk instead.</p>

<p>Many people simply cannot tolerate lactose, and the same thing is true for most cats. Find out whether cats drink. Now you know that the answer is yes, but it’s not necessarily good for them. Most cats have an intolerance to the lactose in cow’s milk and it can cause digestive problems. We all have in our minds images from movies or cartoons of a hungry cat lapping with pleasure in small sips of milk.</p>

<p>You can offer small amounts as a treat. When undigested, lactose makes its way through the cat�s digestive system and takes in water from the intestines. For example, whole milk contains about 24% more lactose than whipped cream. Your cat may beg you for it, but it would be best to make it a rare treat rather than a frequent staple. Cats are attracted to the cream that settles on top of a bowl especially when the milk is derived directly from a cow.</p>

<p>You can give these as treats, but “in general, there is no reason to use them unless the cat has developed an unusual taste for them, wynn says. But it may surprise you to learn that sipping at cows’ milk is actually detrimental to their health, no matter how much they make like the taste of it. Like cow�s milk, it can cause tummy troubles as well as itchy skin. Although your cat shouldn�t drink milk for a meal, you can satisfy her cravings with foods prepared with it as an ingredient. But this doesn’t mean it’s a good idea to give your cat soy milk or almond milk.</p>

<p>Evaporated milks resemble mother cats� milk. It is undeniable that the fresh taste of milk will appeal to your cat. It’s been passed on for so long that many people just assume that cats need to drink milk as a core dietary staple. Some cats can tolerate it, but most cats are lactose intolerant and they should not have it as a part of their diet. For example, whole milk contains about 24% more lactose than whipped cream.</p>

<p>Most cats have an intolerance to the lactose in cow’s milk and it can cause digestive problems. Cats that aren’t lactose intolerant can be given a small amount of cow’s milk, but it’s still better to give them yogurt, kefir, or goat’s milk instead. But it may surprise you to learn that sipping at cows’ milk is actually detrimental to their health, no matter how much they make like the taste of it. It seems like cats and milk go together like any classic pairing—monkeys and bananas, dogs and bones, the sun and the moon. This milk especially for cats is cat milk, it’s like regular cow milk, only the lactose is removed from the milk.</p>

<p>It can result in a lot of weight gain while providing very little nutritional value (though very delicious). Now that you know the answer to the question of, “can cats drink milk,” is “no,” make. Yes, some cats can drink a very small amount of cow�s milk, but you should be careful. The bad far outweighs the good, and you want to avoid giving your cat things that will upset their stomachs. You can offer small amounts as a treat.</p>

<p>Evaporated milks resemble mother cats� milk. Although most cats can digest at least one type of milk, that doesn’t mean it’s particularly good for their health. While events like this are adorable, you might wonder if cats really can drink milk. Organic skim milk or milk with a 1% fat content is preferred. For adult cats, treat milk replacers like any other dairy product:</p>
