<p>Cats can eat plenty of human foods such as brown rice, meat, eggs, and vegetables. You’re not in the wrong here. Such as sausage and if it’s healthy for them. Avoid fatty meats, greasy fried meats, or those with salts, nitrates or preservatives. In moderation, a few scraps of plain, unseasoned turkey can be a healthy treat for your cat.</p>

<p>It says ready to eat on the can. Both a raw and cooked turkey is safe for cats. While unseasoned turkey is a healthy meat for your dog, turkey sausage may contain seasonings that aren�t safe for your dog. A sausage is okay for the cat to eat or not, it depends on the ingredients are used to make a specific sausage. It is also a highly digestible protein source for dogs.</p>
