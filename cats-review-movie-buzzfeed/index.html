<p>Eliot’s “old possum’s book of practical cats” for the stage. Cats hits cinemas today, and the majority of reviews for the movie are extremely negative. What unites us, then, is the feeling of cats, which is like a fever dream of feline breasts and tufted celebrity faces that grows even stranger upon waking. Will surely see the movie again.

<p>Elba’s work in cats might be deeply upsetting but at least his interpretation of a cat is the most accurate: The review embargo for the upcoming movie adaptation of cats, directed by tom hooper, lifted on wednesday night and critics all across the internet have been coughing up furballs. If you�re not familiar with the andrew lloyd webber musical, cats is based on old possum�s book of practical cats by t.s. You have to have a special mindset to fully appreciate the deliciously weirdness of the movie. But no, cats is far from the worst movie of the decade, much less the year.</p>

<p>Cats is a case study in how not to adapt a musical. But corey was far from the only one that couldn�t believe what he saw with cats.in fact, while most reviews certainly say that cats is a movie to be avoided, there are a number of them that, while. The cats press tour has been so robust and so few people actually went to a theater and saw the film during its opening weekend that it’s likely no two people’s idea of what cats is like is remotely similar. Cats hits cinemas today, and the majority of reviews for the movie are extremely negative. Terrible cats, testing your biological age, and more news.</p>
