<p>Ground beef is cheap, easy to prepare and easy for cats to digest. Food allergies, namely turkey allergies, are common in cats. Give your kitty some cooked beef, chicken, turkey, even deli meats from your local grocery store. Make sure you only feed your dog turkey meat. Deli meat is very high in sodium and nitrates/nitrites, none of which are good for cats at all.</p>

<p>I just got a raw fed ferret, so i�m still not sure how much meat to thaw and how much an amount will last. “can dogs and cats eat turkey?” yes, they can eat turkey. If you aren’t absolutely positive, it isn’t worth taking the risk. Be careful and don’t feed them raw meat, or you could make your cat sick. The scent of cooked meat or fish will often tempt a cat.</p>
