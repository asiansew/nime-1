Canned beans usually contain a lot of salt to make them taste better to us but cats are much less tolerant to salt than we are. Cats can eat fresh, frozen or cooked peas. They are not toxic to cats. Vegetables that are harmless to us humans can be addictive.</p>

<p>If you’ve never really thought about your cat’s food before, we’ll make it easy for you. Cats should never have onion, garlic, kelp, grapes or raisins, sugary treats, chocolate, and alcoholic or caffeinated drinks, even in small doses. Cats are carnivores, which means they need a diet that mainly consists of proteins. Pinto beans and green beans are good for a cat; The vegetable slowed down the gobbling up of his food, added volume without many calories to help him feel full, and easily fit into my budget.</p>
