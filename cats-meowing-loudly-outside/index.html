When your old cat meows all the time, especially loud yowling at night, there could be a serious health problem. If your cat is meowing at night on a frequent basis, it’s a good idea to consult with a vet to check up on their health.</p>

<p>It’s clear in this case that you want to protect your door. Some cats are more vocal than others. Why are my two cats meowing loudly at each other? Since there are several reasons why cats meow, i thought i would cover a few of them. Some cats are simply more vocal than others.</p>

<p>Cats also yowl—a sound similar to the meow but more drawn out and melodic. She has a clean litter tray, fresh water, milk and food. Cats don’t meow at other cats — they communicate through body language, scent, and touch. The most common stressors are a big move, a new baby in the house, or an event where many people come over.
