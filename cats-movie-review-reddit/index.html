<p>The cats movie reviews are in, and folks, they are…not great. The reviews ranged from critiques about the absolute madness of the production to confusion over the choice. The cat�s out of the bag. I was disappointed with what i got. The protagonist doesn�t do anything.</p>

<p>The cats movie is weird as heck, but our reviewer absolutely loved it on its own terms. Cats functions more like an anthology of songs and musical theater numbers than it does as an intricate or compelling story. Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. 23.7m members in the movies community. The queasy fears prompted by one of the most disturbing movie trailers ever seen are realised in full in tom.</p>

<p>Cats is terrible, in my opinion, for totally mundane reasons that have nothing to do with the cats or the bad cgi: It�s essentially about a bunch of felines — called jellicle cats. Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. Thank god cats the movie has stayed true to cats the musical. The cats movie is weird as heck, but our reviewer absolutely loved it on its own terms.</p>
