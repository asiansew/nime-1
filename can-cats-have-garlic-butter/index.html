<p>Some tuna now and then probably won�t hurt. Why cats can’t eat butter. When it comes to whether cats can eat garlic, keep in mind that it is estimated to be roughly five times more toxic than onions. These are all part of the allium plant family. Cats can be addicted to tuna, whether it�s packed for cats or for humans.</p>

<p>Cats with symptoms of lethargy, weakness, reduced appetite, pale gums, and orange to dark red urine should be taken to the vet immediately. If your pasta sauce contains garlic, onions, or large amounts of salt, do not even let them have a lick of it! Cats can be addicted to tuna, whether it�s packed for cats or for humans. Peanut butter isn�t toxic to cats, unlike foods such as garlic, onions, and raisins. Fat trimmings can also cause pancreatitis in cats.</p>

<p>A small amount of onion or garlic in some sauce is not likely to cause problems. There aren’t any known negative side effects to giving a cat butter. When it comes to whether cats can eat garlic, keep in mind that it is estimated to be roughly five times more toxic than onions. However, garlic is toxic to cats, so it should never be included in their diet. Onions, as well as garlic, contain an element called thiosulphate, which is toxic to cats.</p>

<p>Most cats won�t eat enough garlic butter to cause this problem. These foods are typically poisonous when eaten in large quantities, but exposure to concentrated forms of onion or garlic, such as onion soup mix or garlic powder, can also be toxic. The aspca’s list of human foods that are toxic for cats does not mention peanut butter, so it is technically safe. But in some situations, peanut butter can still be unsafe for your feline. Fat trimmings can also cause pancreatitis in cats.</p>
