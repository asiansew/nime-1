<p>That’s why orange cats are usually male. Like being stroked, but dislike being picked up and cuddled.” a 1973 book published by pedigree foods described ginger tabbies as “quiet, docile and affectionate.” in a recent study at the university of california, cat owners were asked to attribute personality traits to their cats. The only ones that weren�t as playful were over 10 years old. In cats with orange fur, pheomelanin (red pigment) completely replaces eumelanin (black pigment). Tabby is a pattern of kitty’s coat, and it happens to be the most amazing of all the feline coat patterns.</p>
