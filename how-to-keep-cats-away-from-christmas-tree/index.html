<p>Keep your cats safe this christmas holiday with this easy, cheap and mess free idea. I have 6 cats and each has decided whether or not theyï¿½re interested in the christmas tree. My dog has already knocked bulbs off the tree a bunch of times so i might just get the saran wrap out and call it a day. You can also use the christmas tree defender, which works great at preventing cats from climbing up a tree from the bottom! Getting ready for the holidays and about to put your christmas tree up?</p>

<p>We all know cats are assholes and dogs are clumsy sometimes. Apple cider vinegar, citronella oil spray, and orange juice can all be applied around your tree to repel your cat. Broken ornaments can cause cuts on catsï¿½ mouths or paws. Getting ready for the holidays and about to put your christmas tree up? Christmas tree water often uses additives, like aspirin, to help keep your tree perky and green all through the holidays.</p>

<p>I just wanted you to know that i am a big fan of the christmas tree defender. Use your tree skirt to cover the top of the tree stand and keep thirsty pets away from the water. Pets who are attracted to the tree water take a sip and become sick. You can also use the christmas tree defender, which works great at preventing cats from climbing up a tree from the bottom! Keep your cats safe this christmas holiday with this easy, cheap and mess free idea.</p>
