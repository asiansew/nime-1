<p>Keep your cats safe this christmas holiday with this easy, cheap and mess free idea. I have 6 cats and each has decided whether or not they�re interested in the christmas tree. My dog has already knocked bulbs off the tree a bunch of times so i might just get the saran wrap out and call it a day. You can also use the christmas tree defender, which works great at preventing cats from climbing up a tree from the bottom! Getting ready for the holidays and about to put your christmas tree up?</p>

Broken ornaments can cause cuts on cats� mouths or paws. Getting ready for the holidays and about to put your christmas tree up? Christmas tree water often uses additives, like aspirin, to help keep your tree perky and green all through the holidays.</p>
