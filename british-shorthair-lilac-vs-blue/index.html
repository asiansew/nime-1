<p>British shorthair is one of the most popular breeds of pets most especially in the united kingdom. The british shorthair (left) comes in many different colors and patterns, but the blue variety is most popular — in fact, those cats are often described as “british blues,” as if they were a separate breed (they’re not).

The british shorthair has a broad chest, muscular neck, strong jaws and a well developed muzzle. It usually has golden yellow eyes, wide and round eye lines.</p>
