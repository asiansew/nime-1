Best thing to do is give him a sliver of meat from dinner or something. If you have a picnic or a party, you can leave it out for up to two hours, then put it back in the fridge. Make sure not to feed them raw or spoiled meats.</p>

<p>Dogs can usually eat turkey unless they have medical conditions like allergies, and you must remove any bones from the meat beforehand. Give your kitty some cooked beef, chicken, turkey, even deli meats from your local grocery store. Feeding your cat closer to earth is good for him/her however you will still want to give dry or wet food as well so that they are getting the other nutriants they need. My personal favourite is heart because of its high taurine content and since it is usually available. Turkey is ok to feed your cat.</p>
