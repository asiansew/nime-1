<p>In addition to being a real purr machine, momo the orange tabby cat seeks affection every waking. We have the sweetest and strangest female orange tabby with no white on her, cassie. Approximately 20 percent of orange tabby cats are female. When choosing orange cat names, you can be as creative as you want to be. If you happen to own an orange cat or kitten who is a girl cat, you have a very special kitty on your hands!</p>

<p>2 males and 1 female, lazy you say, not a chance here. But earlier in the year there was a litter of kittens, sadly all dead now, on the road or through foxes, who included red and grey tabbies, white and solid grey. Female orange tabby cats aren�t uncommon; Between dominant genes, modifier genes, white spotting, and different fathers, no wonder kittens in a litter can have a variety of coat colours. I heard cats can have multiple fathers and i was wondering if you could tell what color her kittens will be.</p>

<p>But earlier in the year there was a litter of kittens, sadly all dead now, on the road or through foxes, who included red and grey tabbies, white and solid grey. The female cat, therefore, can have the orange mutant gene on one x chromosome and the gene for a black coat on the other. What color kittens would a male orange tabby and a female orange tabby cat have? But both drool when they are purring. The eldest orange tabby cats are brother and sister, both standard sized tabby cats, then i have a miniature male orange tabby, now him, he’ll eat forever and never gain weight!</p>
