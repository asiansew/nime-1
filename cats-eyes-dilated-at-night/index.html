This will invariably lead to a range of side effects. So even in a bright room, the eyes stay dilated. There are natural reasons for big pupils in cats, especially since light entering the eye causes a natural change in pupil size.when the dilated pupils are sustained over a long time, even when the ambient light changes, there may be other reasons for the phenomenon.</p>

<p>A cat’s eyes should only glow at night, especially for prolonged periods. Since cloudy eye is symptomatic of a number of serious eye conditions, immediate veterinary attention should be sought in order to ensure the best prognosis for your cat’s sight. For immediate care, c lean the eyes and nose with cotton moistened with warm water, w arm your cat’s food to help bring back his appetite and, a lways make fresh drinking water available. A cat that has consumed toxins will frequently display dilated eyes. Cats have evolved to hide signs of illness and pain.</p>

<p>My fiv boy is totally blind. This will invariably lead to a range of side effects. This morning he seemed normal but his eye was very watery. Hi, i am an experienced veterinarian and happy to help! Up to 60 percent of your cat�s sleep is rem sleep, three times more than we have when we are asleep.</p>
