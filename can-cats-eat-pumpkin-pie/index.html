Make sure what ever veggies you give your kitty have no salt or spices, that they are just plain. But, you should not add any added sugar and spice to pumpkin. Pumpkin pie filling contains sugar and spices that not only are unnecessary for your dog’s diet but may cause the digestive upset you are trying to prevent.</p>

<p>The zinc in pumpkin can contribute to a healthy coat. Pie filling is also not a pure, whole food like real pumpkin is. It�s high in fiber and vitamins that are essential. You can grab fresh, canned, or even frozen peas from most groceries, and unlike other contenders on this list, they can be served raw or cooked. Pumpkin is great to feed if a cat has diarreha or constipation.</p>

<p>Mix between one and four teaspoons of canned pumpkin with cat food one to two times a day. Your veterinarian can advise the specific quantity of pumpkin to serve, depending on your cat’s condition. And even though pumpkin isn’t something that cats normally eat in the wild, in some cases, you can use it as an alternative for. There are several pumpkin dog treats, canned pumpkin dog food, pumpkin supplements, and also raw or canned pumpkin your dog will love. If you buy a pie pumpkin, save the seeds to plant next year or buy pie pumpkin seeds to plant.</p>
