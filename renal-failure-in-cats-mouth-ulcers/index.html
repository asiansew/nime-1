<p>This is one of the most common reasons pet owners bring their cats to us when renal failure is the cause. Kidney disease leads to renal failure, a leading cause of mortality in cats. Look closely and you’ll see another ulcer on the edge of the tongue. Also, excess phosphate and this leads to muscle weakness, bone pain and loss of appetite. In other words, feline stomatitis is believed to be an overreaction of the immune system, causing the feline&amp;rsquo;s own immune system to attack bacteria in the mouth as well as its oral tissues.</p>

<p>Only about 10% of the cases occur in cats less than three years old. Also, excess phosphate and this leads to muscle weakness, bone pain and loss of appetite. It often begins to manifest in middle age, making older cats far more at risk. Ulcers on the gums and tongue can often be a sign of kidney disease in cats. When kidney disease occurs, it compromises the kidney’s abilities to perform these important tasks.</p>

<p>These have occurred due to high blood levels of toxins that are normally excreted by the kidneys. Kidney failure usually affects older cats, but younger felines afflicted with the condition may lose their teeth. Older cats aren’t the only ones at risk. Also, excess phosphate and this leads to muscle weakness, bone pain and loss of appetite. Because renal failure affects bone density, cats might easily break bones.</p>
