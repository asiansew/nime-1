<p>[chorus] e d and the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon g a little boy blue and the man in the moon e d when you comin� home son, i don�t know when g e we�ll get together then dad g e you know we�ll have a good time then. Ugly kid joe�s sound includes a range of styles, including hard rock, funk metal and heavy metal. I wasn�t aware the song was originally by harry chapin, thanks! Although originally intended to be poem, its lyrical and rhythmic nature has led to it becoming regarded as one of the most successful folk rock songs. Through all the pain as a teenager, i felt comforted by the song as it was a warning to my dad that if he continued to be distant emotionally, then one day i would not have time for him.</p>
