<p>Artificial trees are normally made of pvc (polyvinyl chloride). But are christmas trees toxic to cats? Pvc is a type of plastic made of vinyl chloride that has been classified as “carcinogenic to humans” by the international agency for research on cancer. Tree needles, if digested can cause gastrointestinal obstruction , gastrointestinal irritation, and/or vomiting. The holidays are like a gift that keeps on giving.</p>

One of the things that really signals christmas is here, is putting up the christmas tree and decorations. I could keep my cat mia downstairs for the whole of christmas.
