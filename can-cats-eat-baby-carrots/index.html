Carrots contain a great source of vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber that helps to slow down the progression of dental diseases in dogs. The short answer is yes, carrots are healthy food for cats, but there are ways you can prepare them that are not so healthy. Not only can dogs safely eat carrots, but carrots are a low calorie treat with tremendous health and dental benefits.</p>

<p>The answer is yes, cats can eat certain types of baby food in moderation. Whether they should or not will depend on their personal preferences for it, and is ultimately up to you as an owner. Baby bunnies below the 12 weeks should not eat carrots or any other fresh foods, including veggies and fruits. Cats can eat fresh, frozen or cooked peas. I would not give a dog more than half a stick of carrot a day for more than 3 days a week.</p>

<p>The short answer is yes, carrots are healthy food for cats, but there are ways you can prepare them that are not so healthy. Aside from that, carrots should not be fed to cats alone. Carrots contain a great source of vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber that helps to slow down the progression of dental diseases in dogs. As is true for most vegetables, however, carrots should be cooked before feeding them to your cat. And, sometimes you can give them as a treat.</p>
