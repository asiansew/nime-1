<p>Toubou nomads living northwest of lake chad consider sand cats frequent chicken thieves which readily enter their camp in the evenings. Although, i have never actually heard of people keeping them as pets. Your black and white dismissal of all �wild� animals as �bad pets� reveals you have a simplistic view. Is a good example of this type of device. Since you can’t wash the sand itself, wash any toys in the sandbox with soap and water or wipe them down with disinfectant wipes.</p>

You’ll also want to plan to replace all of the sand every 1 to 2 years. Be sure to cover the container with wire mesh to prevent your little bug from escaping. If a person can keep a gerbil, they can keep a serval, period. An inexpensive method is to pour distilled white vinegar around the outside of the box once a month.</p>
