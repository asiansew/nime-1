<p>Remember, when introducing new foods to your cat, there will be some gastrointestinal upset. Additionally, turkey necks are rich in glucosamine and chondroitin, which are both known to support the joint health and mobility of dogs. Cooked bones in general become more brittle and they splinter more easily. Plain, white meat turkey with no bones will usually make for a safe treat for pups, but there are plenty of exceptions. Feeding turkey bones to dogs or cats is not recommended.</p>

<p>Can cats eat chicken bones? It is fine to give them a small piece at dinner or let them eat some leftovers. Small bones can cause choking, and bones are often brittle, which can cause oral punctures or cuts (to the tongue, lips, or mucous membranes), esophageal/intestinal obstruction, or constipation. However, cats can’t eat cooked chicken bones. Avoid feeding them the skin and bones, and don’t use any seasonings.</p>
