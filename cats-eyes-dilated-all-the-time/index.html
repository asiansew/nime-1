<p>Dilated pupils can signify serious infection, head or brain trauma or tumor, poisoning, or disease and will need diagnostic tests to determine the cause. Venom is a form of poison secreted by several animals in defence or to kill their prey. They didn�t use to but the last few days they are scary looking because they are staying dilated. I don�t know the maximum, but i�ll use some of my cats as an example. It can be a sign of a physical ailment or disease if it�s a constant condition, such as hypertension, anisocoria, or dysautonomia.</p>

<p>So even in a bright room, the eyes stay dilated. Droopy eyelids, discharges that are green, yellow, or white, squinting, pupils that are dilated or constricted, or anisocoria (one pupil dilated and the other constricted are all signs that something is amiss. The reason that the eyes are dilated is because your cat is effectively blind. Your cat could also be sick. You can test this by putting some obstacles in a corridor and watch to see if they bounce into things or their whiskers are pointing right forward all the time so they �feel� their way around using their whiskers.</p>
