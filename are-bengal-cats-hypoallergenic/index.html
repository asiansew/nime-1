This “hypoallergenic” cat list should not be the only thing you consider when researching which breed of cat to adopt. Their golden shimmer comes from their leopard cat ancestry, and their coats may show spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or.</p>

<p>Many people who are allergic to cats still love cats and want to own one, which is why they will look for cats that are considered to be hypoallergenic.these are cats that have less of the fel d1 which means that they do not cause an allergic reaction in people that are allergic or else they cause a less severe reaction. Relative to other cats, bengals may cause less of an allergic reaction. One of the most frequent questions we get from people is whether or not bengal cats are hypoallergenic? There are no cats which are truly hypoallergenic, but there are some breeds which will not aggravate allergies as bad as others. Most people who are allergic to cats have either no allergic reaction or a more milder reaction to bengal cats when compared to the majority of other breeds.</p>

<p>In addition, bengal cats shed considerably less than other cat breeds, so the dander in their fur doesn’t spread around as much. The bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic cats, especially the spotted egyptian mau, with the asian leopard cat (prionailurus bengalensis).the breed name comes from the leopard cat�s taxonomic name. I really hate to break this to you, but there’s not really any such thing as a truly hypoallergenic cat. Technically however, there really are no domestic cats that are 100% hypoallergenic. It means relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction.</p>

<p>We breed beautiful brown, and snow spotted/rosetted bengals kittens , from our top quality pedigree bengal cats. The answer is yes, bengal cats are hypoallergenic. One of the most frequent questions we get from people is whether or not bengal cats are hypoallergenic? It’s actually more like bark kind of raspy sound. All cats produce this protein to some degree, so all cats are somewhat allergenic.</p>
