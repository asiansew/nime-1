The symptoms of kidney disease in cats are similar to those found in humans. Loss of appetite, lethargy and convulsions aren�t the only symptoms cats in stage iv kidney failure may exhibit, although they are the most common. Researchers cannot say for sure why cats develop it, but other medical issues can lead to kidney disease, such as an infection, a virus, gum disease, and dehydration. In the initial stages of kidney failure, the kidneys cope with their inability to efficiently remove waste products by excreting them at a lower concentration over a larger volume (in other words, by producing a larger amount of more dilute urine). Unfortunately with this disease a cat can appear to be healthy.</p>

<p>As cats get closer to death the symptoms become much more severe. Understanding the stages and signs of kidney disease can help to extend your cat’s life, and keep them comfortable for as long as possible through this stage of their life. Cats will often drink more to compensate for this increased rate of body water loss. When they stop eating, the end is not far way. Watching your beloved pet suffer more and more may become intolerable.</p>

<p>Kidney failure can be sneaky, creeping up on both cat and guardian without symptoms until later stages. Researchers cannot say for sure why cats develop it, but other medical issues can lead to kidney disease, such as an infection, a virus, gum disease, and dehydration. Polycystic kidneys causes cysts on the kidneys (fluid filled balloons) which stops them working properly. Cats experiencing the final stages of kidney failure, also known as chronic renal failure (crf), do not experience physical pain, but they do feel the discomfort of being ill and require extra attention and aid. Being sensitive to your cat�s condition can help you provide the treatment and care they deserve in their last days.</p>

<p>Watching your beloved pet suffer more and more may become intolerable. Cats with polycystic kidneys often develop kidney disease at a young age. You�ll start to see violent symptoms, including seizures, loss of consciousness, tremors and more. However, kidney failure can make a cat feel lousy and not in the mood to drink water. I adopted my cat at age 14 and she was in stage 3 kidney failure.</p>
