This change may be described as a “film” covering the cat’s eye or as an increased cloudy “whiteness” to the cat’s eye. Cats can develop cat eye problems not just from a direct problem with their eyes such as cat glaucoma or cat herpes, but also secondary to systemic cat diseases such as feline immunodeficiency virus or cat leukemia. Hi, mil�s cat has its pupils constantly dilated even during the day (we live with mil for the moment), the house is quite dark but it is sunny today and still all black pupils.</p>

<p>Glaucoma in cats is a disease that involves increased pressure of fluid inside the eye (aqueous humor). In cats, as well as humans,have drainage channels that, if blocked, cause the aqueous humor to accumulate. When frisky is very playful or feeling stressed, her pupils can become very large to reflect her feelings.

<p>Watch for signs of discomfort such as squinting or rubbing, as well as redness and discharge. Miss kitty is three years old. Anisocoria refers to a medical condition of unequal pupil size where one of a cat�s pupils is smaller than the other. A cloudy eye or increased opacity of the eye is associated with reduced transparency of either the cornea, the fluid media within the eye, or the lens. She told me that under the same lighting my cat�s eyes were dilated and her cat�s weren�t.</p>

It only becomes a concern if the pupils never contract. I�m sure many of you have experienced a lasting interest in a condition when a cat Cat owners always tend to be extremely close with their pets and there is always a lot of affection shown by both the owner and the cat, so you are always likely to notice any. Let�s break down each part of the eye to find out what constitutes normal and what doesn�t.</p>
