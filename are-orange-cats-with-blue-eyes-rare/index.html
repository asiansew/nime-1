<p>Lykois were accepted into the cat fanciers association in 2018 in the miscellaneous status group and have championship status in the international cat association. Russian blues always have green eyes where siamese cats always have blue eyes. Deafness is far more common in white cats than in those with other coat colours. Most, however, will have gold or green eyes. I have green and orange eyes but my mom doesn’t believe me.</p>

<p>Blue eyes are common in predominantly (solid) white cats and in cats with pointed markings. Their eye color is decided by something called melanin. I have a blue girl with green eyes and in sun lite she looks lilac and silver. The snowshoe is a relatively rare breed which has the siamese as its ancestor. Red tabbies with blue eyes as an adult cat are pretty rare.</p>

<p>The eyes change color later to the adult color, which ranges from green to hazel to orange to copper. Amanda on june 03, 2020: 3 months later she was getting adjusted to our chiahuaha and 2 other cats but mostly still. Can black cats have blue eyes? Cats that have those beautiful blue eyes have lower levels of melanin in their eyes.</p>
