<p>For the same reasons we humans don’t eat raw eggs, your cat shouldn’t eat them as well. They are also a good source of some of the b vitamins. These pests can jump up about 12 inches high onto an unlucky host, feed, and then lay eggs in the fur. Eating raw eggs can lead to salmonella. Raw eggs can be dangerous.</p>

<p>As i have mentioned before, rice does not have taurine which is badly needed by cats. Eggs should not be fed to cats every day, as they are not nutritionally balanced. Oats have a lot of protein per calorie, and they�re easy to make. A lot of cats seem to really enjoy the taste of scrambled eggs, especially if they have certain other foods mixed in with them. Your cats can eat rice every now and then but it should not be a lifestyle like what a huge population of asians has made it to be.</p>

<p>Some tuna now and then probably won�t hurt. Being carnivores, cats benefit from eggs protein and amino acids. Eating turtles are more common. Feeding your dog eggs can be a healthy treat, but find out the proper way to allow your dog to eat eggs and which parts of an egg are bad for dogs to eat. I am 92 years old, and as far back as i can remember, which admittedly is sometimes not far, the traditional saucer of milk has been the basic intake for the family house cat, the barn cat and the cat waiting by the milking pail for a squirt of milk directly from the cows teat.</p>
