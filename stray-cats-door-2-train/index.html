<p>Before you try to tame a stray cat, take it to the vet so it can be treated for diseases, fleas, and other ailments. Rodents are easier to catch than other animals, like birds, and cats will sit and wait for mice and rats to emerge from burrows and other hiding places. Gently take kitty�s paws and make scratching motions to transfer some of her scent. We have 4 albums and 117 song lyrics in our database. Train to use a litter box.</p>

<p>Cats need to scratch so the answer is to provide scratching posts the cat will enjoy using. I would clean my door (to prevent oil build up) and then spray it every morning and evening as part of a daily routine. For more on feeding patterns, also see the 7 steps of tnr. Feeding feral and stray cats is generous, but they need health care as well. However, you want to let him stick to one type of litter and litter box.</p>

<p>Stray cats may be lost house pets with an owner frantic for their return. Generally speaking, the process of training a cat is more challenging for people accustomed to training dogs or other animals because kittens are much more independent and less interested in the opinions of humans than other house pets. Gently take kitty�s paws and make scratching motions to transfer some of her scent. In these cases, it seems as if stray cats decide to “adopt” an unsuspecting person as their new caretaker. Before you try to tame a stray cat, take it to the vet so it can be treated for diseases, fleas, and other ailments.</p>
