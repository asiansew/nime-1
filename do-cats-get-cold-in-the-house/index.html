Probably the best prescription for winter�s woes is to keep your cat inside with you and your family. But this doesn’t mean it can keep your cat warm in the winter. Similarly to humans, some cats may feel the cold more than others. Just like humans, cats are different from one another.</p>

<p>Kittens or young cats do not have entirely developed immune systems. In cold temperatures, your cat will feel much colder than we do therefore, we need to take some action to help kitty get some warmth. Cats can adapt well to cold weather but if it goes below freezing then you’re asking for trouble cats can catch frostbites or hypothermia which can be dangerous to your cats health i would recommend you get a outdoor kitty house that can be warmed up to keep your cat warm in the night during winter The best way to prevent this is to minimize their contact with outside animals. What temperature do cats like?</p>

<p>In cold temperatures, your cat will feel much colder than we do therefore, we need to take some action to help kitty get some warmth. Older cats over 7 years old have weakened immune systems. Watching your beloved cat suffer from a cold is tough, but the good news is that most cat colds are generally not serious and only last at most seven to ten days. The cold can leave elderly cats� joints stiff and tender, causing pain when they walk or lay down also makes it difficult to get around the house make sure to provide low spaces where they have easy access to nap in. The first thing to know is that, in cold temperatures your cat will actually feel colder.although these animals prepare for winter by changing their fur, some breeds do have shorter and less dense coats (such as the persian, siamese, devon rex cats or the sphynx that has no hair at all) and will therefore feel the cold more and will require special care.</p>
