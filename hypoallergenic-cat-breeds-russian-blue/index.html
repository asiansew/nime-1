<p>She may be a good choice for pet parents with allergies because she doesn�t shed much and produces lower levels of the glycoprotein fel d 1, a known allergen, than other cat breeds. That’s because they produce the least of the fel d 1 protein unlike any other cats. But, i have found out about these �hypoallergenic cats�, which produce less fel d 1, or don�t shed as much. Russian blues have a short, dense coat which tends to shed less and produce less fel d1 than other. These breeds produce fewer allergens which make cat parenting with a sensitive nose quite easier!</p>

<p>She may be a good choice for pet parents with allergies because she doesn�t shed much and produces lower levels of the glycoprotein fel d 1, a known allergen, than other cat breeds. Some feline breeds exist that are considered low allergy or hypoallergenic cats. It is a large cat with a lush double coat, but it is hypoallergenic, so you don’t have to worry. Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva.
