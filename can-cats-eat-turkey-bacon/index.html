<p>Usually 1/3 of a strip cut into little pieces is sufficient. Can cats eat raw bacon or ham? Other processed meat like turkey bacon, they are considered a healthier alternative to the pork bacon. To cover the basics, turkey bacon typically contains a lot of salt and fat, which is just as harmful to cats as it is for us. Bacon comes from the belly, sides, or back of a pig.</p>

<p>Just like humans, the biggest concern about bacon for cats is the extremely high amount of salt. It is strictly not recommended. It must be raw and not be cured. Omelette is not safe for cats if it has wild mushrooms, garlic, onions or chives. Like cat treats, it is not a meal but a reward or treat.</p>

<p>A small piece of sausage, them, would be out of harm’s way. You may have also noticed there is usually a lack of pork, bacon, ham, and meats like this from their foods.

A healthy alternative that humans love to try is turkey bacon.</p>
