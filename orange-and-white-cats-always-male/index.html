I also used to think this was the case, until finally my veterinarian told me that really only about 80% of “red” (or “orange” or “yellow” or “ginger”) tabbies are male. Ginger cats are more likely to be male than female.</p>

<p>Any cat, male or female, can be orange, but in males the color is nearly always expressed in the tabby (striped) pattern, sometimes called a ginger tom. Male orange tabby cats outnumber females approximately 4 to 1. He was extremely striking as well, that very bright orange color that some of the marmalade cats seem to have.

<p>It turns out ginger cats aren�t always male. A female would have to get two o genes to be an orange tabby. Ginger cats are more likely to be male than female. Since any red color is epistatic, all orange cats are tabbies and solid red show cats are usually a low contrast ticked tabby. In the absence of other influences, such as color inhibition that causes white fur, the alleles present in those orange loci determine whether the fur is orange or not.</p>

<p>Male tortoiseshells are rare and are usually sterile. Calico and tortoiseshell cats, however, are almost always female. Cats come in a wide range of colors, from plain black or white to gray, brown and orange. All red cats are tabby cats. Although some red cats (usually dilutes) may appear to be a solid color, upon closer examination, you will see the pale stripes, whorls, or spots of the tabby.</p>
