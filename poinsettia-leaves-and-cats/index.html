<p>All parts of the poinsettia plant can be mildly irritating to the mouth and stomach. Reply:no, it is a myth. We have a 3 year old female siamese mix cat that’s about 10 pounds. If the leaves are ingested, they will often cause nausea and vomiting, but it would take a large amount of the plant’s material to cause poisoning, and most animals and children won’t eat such a large enough amount. Continue keeping the plant in a bright, sunny window.</p>

<p>However, they only cause mild symptoms and do not pose a great danger to cats. If you caught your cat in the act of eating any part of a poinsettia, let your vet know too. We have a 3 year old female siamese mix cat that’s about 10 pounds. It is still a good idea to keep pets from ingesting the leaves of the poinsettia. As for cats, it can be a little harmful, but not fatal.</p>

<p>Well, much like with pets, the leaves and blooms of the poinsettia are far from deadly when ingested. Trim off two to three inches of branches to promote side branching. There haven�t been any deaths reported due to eating poinsettia leaves,” wahl. The poisonous part of the plant is the milky white sap found inside leaves and flowers. Apply a cool compress to ease itching.</p>

<p>3 if your poinsettia has been treated with pesticides, though, those pesticides can be fatal to cats. During the holidays, poinsettias are a popular christmas plant.
