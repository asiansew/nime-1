My house mate wants to get a christmas tree for the living room. As a cat person who has had everything from fake to real trees, i’d like to shed some light on the subject and give you some ideas as to what to expect and how to handle your cats being around fake christmas trees.</p>

<p>Christmas tree dangers to cats. Others are pretty much uninterested. As a cat person who has had everything from fake to real trees, i’d like to shed some light on the subject and give you some ideas as to what to expect and how to handle your cats being around fake christmas trees. One of the things that really signals christmas is here, is putting up the christmas tree and decorations. Real christmas trees contain fir tree oil that is considered to be mildly toxic to cats.</p>

<p>Most christmas trees are made of toxic pvc material and have fire retardant chemicals. I had no idea, and gave it no thought! However, there are some artificial christmas trees that are made of safer plastic such as polyethylene (pe). Stop your cat from knocking the christmas tree over Poinsettias, or christmas stars a very popular decorative plant at christmas because of their pretty, brightly colored leaves, poinsettias can give cats and dogs digestive problems and irritate their skin.</p>

<p>Christmas trees, whether real or artificial, can be a hazard for homes with pets during the holiday season. I have heard that they are toxic to cats so i was not a huge fan of having a christmas tree (unless it was a fake christmas tree) but then my other house mate said that he wanted a christmas tree too. I really think this information should have been shared. Christmas trees, whether real or artificial, can be a hazard for homes with pets during the holiday season. If you have any reservations at all about your cat nibbling on your tree, please be cautious.</p>
