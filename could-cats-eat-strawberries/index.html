<p>But, they offer very little nutritional value to cats. These delicious little berries are naturally high in sugar which could give your cat an upset stomach if they eat too much at once. The high amount of salt in popcorns, for one, make it such a dangerous food for our feline friends. Although strawberry is a great refreshing snack for cats, the main nutrition that cats require comes from protein (as they are carnivores) which strawberries do not contain. With that being said, it’s not a valued part of your cat�s diet.</p>

<p>Can i give my cat some strawberries? Cats are obligate carnivores, which means that the majority of their diet should come from meat. So, your cat might get benefit from it. Cats cannot absorb the nutrients found in strawberries. The aspca says that this refreshing fruit is not toxic to cats;</p>
