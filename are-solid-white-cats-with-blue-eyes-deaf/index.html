<p>The number by each diagram is the grade of spotting from grade 0 (no white spotting) through to grade 10 where white spotting has obscured all of the base colour. An estimated 40 percent of white cats with blue eyes are deaf, which is high. Unless both ears are affected, cats may never show any signs of hearing loss. 40 percent of white cats with one blue eye were deaf; The probability of being deaf is based on the color genetics of the cat.</p>

<p>Albino cats are not linked to deafness. About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear; Studies show that, in fact, white felines with blue eyes have a higher prevalence of deafness than solid white felines with green or yellow eyes. Of white cats with one blue eye, about 40 percent are deaf in at least one ear. However, the prevalence of white cats does vary in different geographies.</p>

<p>About half of all white cats are deaf, and those numbers increase in cats with blue eyes, with deafness often found on the same side as the blue eye — left blue eye, deaf in left ear; No, not all pure white cats with blue eyes are deaf, however:. The deaf ear is usually on the same side as the blue eye. Kittens all have blue eyes at birth. There is a band of melanocytes that regulates ion balance in the ear, which plays a crucial role in transmitting sound signals to the brain.</p>
