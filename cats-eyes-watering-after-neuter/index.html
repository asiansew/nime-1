Ocular proptosis is easy to recognize. Hi again, vicky, and thanks for your additional information. My cat�s about 10 years old, he seems and acts perfectly healthy, but for a very long time now, he�s been losing his hair on his underside belly area and a little bit on his back left side. Symptoms of an allergic reaction to cats range from mild to severe, and include swollen, red, itchy, and watery eyes;</p>

<p>Regarding vaccinations, yes, cats (especially those that spend time outside with stray, unvaccinated cats) need to be tested first, for fiv (feline aids) and felv (feline leukemia virus), and if those test results are negative the cat will be vaccinated against those diseases, plus, feline rhinotracheitis (cat flu), and distemper. And it does help with costs, except i get what your are saying, about them being very busy. This cat should receive pain medication asap. The healing process takes up to 2 weeks. In most cases, a cat stuffy develops after a runny nose has manifested.</p>

<p>Neutered males can still get female cats that haven’t been fixed pregnant up to 30 days after the procedure. If your cat�s eyes are normal today and bulging tomorrow, glaucoma is the most likely suspect. The first 24 hours after a neuter surgery are critical for your dog�s safety and recovery. Hi again, vicky, and thanks for your additional information. 99% of the time, when your cat randomly sneezes, it’s because they got a bit of fluff up their nose, just like when you or i sneeze.</p>

<p>If you notice your cat’s face looks puffier than usual, he could be suffering from facial swelling. Does any one know that this might happen after getting a cat neutered since they put a gel in their eyes when they get put to sleep? Yesterday i noticed a few drops of blood on the floor. :o about two weeks ago our cat began sneezing, was lethargic and off his food. Aggression &amp; newly spayed cats.</p>

<p>If the cats in your yard are feral cats, consider helping control the feral cat population by trapping the cats, neutering them, and releasing them. If you see mom, leave the kittens alone. Some interventions can however help to speed up recovery. But by late evening, her nose was red, her ears were bright red, her body was hot and her eyes were definitely red and bothering her. If your cat�s eyes are normal today and bulging tomorrow, glaucoma is the most likely suspect.</p>
