<p>Like chicken, turkey is a lean, white meat that helps dogs build muscle. A good rule of thumb with feeding your cat sausage: All meat will have some bacteria in it; Many cats will enjoy the taste of pork due to its salty, fatty flavor. The most suitable cured meats for cats are sliced turkey and ham, both low in salt if possible.</p>

<p>Though cats can eat all types of meat. Additionally, cats should not eat any raw pork products. They are one of the great food. Most importantly, raw sausage can be contaminated with bacteria, such as salmonella. This means meat passes through the cat faster.</p>
