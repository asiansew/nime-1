<p>Just as long as it�s only a treat occasionally. I think it is a quirk of the breed. No, cats should not eat any quantity of raw chicken. Give your kitty some cooked beef, chicken, turkey, even deli meats from your local grocery store. The majority of protein should be derived from skeletal muscle, such as the breast and thighs, rather than organ meat.</p>

<p>Can turkey be dangerous for cats? Gravy can also contain additional ingredients toxic to cats. Can cats have raw chicken? Salt comes in large quantities usually and too much of it can poison your cat. Since most turkey that we humans buy is already cooked, or frozen and waiting for the oven, it’s tricky to come upon turkey that a cat could have.</p>
