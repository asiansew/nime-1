<p>Acute renal failure develops suddenly, over a matter of days or weeks. Whether or not you decide to euthanize your cat is always a personal decision.

<p>Many of them are curable, but if left untreated, kidney infections can quickly lead to renal failure. Kidney failure is that common. You can treat kidney failure in cats to extend a catâs life, but, unfortunately, a time will come when you have to let your cat go. Stage 1 is the first level of chronic kidney disease in cats or the earliest that the disease can be diagnosed. In cats kidney disease also shows up as selective eating habits and acute blindness.</p>
