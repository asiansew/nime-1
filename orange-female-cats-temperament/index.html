When one carries the dominant orange gene and the other has a nondominant orange gene and the other has a nondominant orange (expressed as black), then the coat is tinted alternately with orange and black. Male cats are xy but can be torties if they inherit an extra x chromosome (xxy). Females have two x chromosomes;</p>

<p>These cats can be long or short haired, and can be male or female, despite the myth that only male felines can be orange, according to sandra toney of petside.com. However, if you plan on getting an orange cat from a breeder, you are going to need to have a lot more patience and understanding. This means there are approximately three ginger males to every ginger female. Garfield, the famous comic character that everyone knows, and milo, from milo and otis, are orange tabbies. Indeed this specific dress is actually linked to a very rare gene in the male cat.</p>

<p>Long haired breeds such as persians, maine coons and american curl can have the orange tabby pattern.

<p>Garfield, the famous comic character that everyone knows, and milo, from milo and otis, are orange tabbies. This means there are approximately three ginger males to every ginger female. This is because when cats of a certain color get together, the females will often present with tortishell markings. If it can still happen that a male is born with a tortoiseshell or turtle coat, this occurs only 1 time out of 3,000. And i have heard and noticed that male cats seem to be only one or two colors, and that almost all three colored cats are female.</p>
