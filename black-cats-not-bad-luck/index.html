<p>In england, up in the yorkshire area, there is an old wives tale that a black cat given to a bride as a wedding gift can actually help to bless the marriage. Although certain areas of europe, such as places in the uk, had some positive black cat superstitions, the black feline was often misunderstood and mistreated. The following is known beliefs regarding this demonic cat species. The fears about black cats spread throughout europe over time and, sadly, mass killings of black cats took place. Not to mention utterly magnificent and, really, just tinier versions of noble panthers.</p>

<p>Black cats are not bad luck! There are some who believe that black cats can be a sign of good things to come. One of the most widespread legends about the supposed bad luck associated with black cats arose in the english county of lincolnshire. Luckily for our feline friends, these bad superstitions have virtually vanished and black cats are now a part of many families across the world. Black cats are believed to be a bad omen by many people to the point that, at the time, killing a black cat that crossed your path was considered an honorable deed.</p>
