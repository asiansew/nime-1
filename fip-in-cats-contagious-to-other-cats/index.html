<p>The coronavirus that causes fip is extremely contagious and in fact just about all cats that are or have been in multicat households, including breeding catteries and shelters, have serological evidence that they have been exposed to the virus. Some cats can have the corona virus their whole lives and it will never mutate into fip, others are not that lucky. It is also more common in cats from catteries and shelter where there is a large number of cats potentially shedding coronavirus (which is necessary because it is what mutates). Direct exposure to cats with fip does not seem to increase the risk for healthy cats. Thanks to a lifetime of dedication and devotion, dr niels pedersen of uc davis discovered the cure for fip:</p>

<p>Although fip may commonly strike an entire litter of kittens, my experience tells me unrelated adult cats rarely pass the fatal form of the virus between each other. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a viral disease in cats which carries a high mortality due to its characteristic aggressiveness and nonresponsiveness to fever, along with other complications. Fip is thought to result from a mutation of the virus within the body that combines with the response of the immune system. The coronavirus that causes fip is extremely contagious and in fact just about all cats that are or have been in multicat households, including breeding catteries and shelters, have serological evidence that they have been exposed to the virus. It is also one of the most complicated diseases known to veterinary medicine.</p>

<p>A contagious disease is spread from animal to animal or person to person. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip), which is caused by a contagious virus, can cause significant illness and death in cats. Chylothorax is more common in cats than dogs.

<p>Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a complex, serious, and ultimately fatal disease of cats, caused by a biotype of feline coronavirus (fcov), called feline infectious peritonitis virus or fip virus (fipv). Fip is a very difficult disease to deal with because there are no clinical signs that are specific for the diagnosis of fip, and no simple blood test to confirm a diagnosis. Fip may be considered more likely when: Caring for a cat with fiv is much the same as caring for any other cat; It is important to note that while fecv is quite contagious (it is passed in the feces and saliva of infected cats and infects other cats primarily via the oral cavity), fipv is not believed to be.</p>

<p>Fip is short for feline infectious peritonitis. Cats are showing clinical signs compatible with fip; It is a contagious virus, with the majority of its cases observed in multifeline households, catteries, and shelters. Chylothorax is more common in cats than dogs. However in the vast majority of cats the virus does not cause disease at all.</p>

<p>The coronavirus that causes fip is extremely contagious and in fact just about all cats that are or have been in multicat households, including breeding catteries and shelters, have serological evidence that they have been exposed to the virus. It is also more common in cats from catteries and shelter where there is a large number of cats potentially shedding coronavirus (which is necessary because it is what mutates). Fcov is very contagious, and your other cats will already have been infected. There are many different strains of feline coronavirus, which differ in their ability to cause disease. Although fip may commonly strike an entire litter of kittens, my experience tells me unrelated adult cats rarely pass the fatal form of the virus between each other.</p>

<p>Cats are in a higher risk category (e.g., younger cats, colony cats, etc.) If you have your other cats antibody tested, you may find that they have higher antibody titres than the one which developed fip, but that does not mean that they will develop fip. The disease has a global distribution, and only affects cats: One of my cats has fip. Although fip may commonly strike an entire litter of kittens, my experience tells me unrelated adult cats rarely pass the fatal form of the virus between each other.</p>

<p>It is also more common in cats from catteries and shelter where there is a large number of cats potentially shedding coronavirus (which is necessary because it is what mutates). The coronavirus that causes fip is extremely contagious and in fact just about all cats that are or have been in multicat households, including breeding catteries and shelters, have serological evidence that they have been exposed to the virus. Rather, fip develops in individual cats after they are infected with fecv and the virus undergoes mutations to become fipv (fipv itself is not passed in the feces). However in the vast majority of cats the virus does not cause disease at all. Fip may be considered more likely when:</p>

<p>However, only about 5% of cats ever develop fip. Direct exposure to cats with fip does not seem to increase the risk for healthy cats. Fip is caused by the mutation of the corona virus, which is highly contagious, as in passed through the litter box, food/water bowls, etc etc. Fip is a very difficult disease to deal with because there are no clinical signs that are specific for the diagnosis of fip, and no simple blood test to confirm a diagnosis. It is, without a doubt, the most dreaded infectious disease of cats.</p>

<p>Caring for a cat with fiv is much the same as caring for any other cat; However in the vast majority of cats the virus does not cause disease at all. Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a complex, serious, and ultimately fatal disease of cats, caused by a biotype of feline coronavirus (fcov), called feline infectious peritonitis virus or fip virus (fipv).

<p>Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a complex, serious, and ultimately fatal disease of cats, caused by a biotype of feline coronavirus (fcov), called feline infectious peritonitis virus or fip virus (fipv).

And may explain the uncommon epizootics of fip where a number of cats in the same environment develop fip within a days or weeks of each other.

All cats should be tested for fiv, and retested any time they’re sick with infection, adopted into a new home, or exposed to other infected cats.</p>
