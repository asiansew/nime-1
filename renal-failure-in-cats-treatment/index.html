Acute renal failure (arf) or acute kidney failure refers to the sudden failure of the kidneys to perform normal filtration duties. Increased thirst is often the first symptom. Kidney disease is very serious, as the kidneys are essential for the health of your cat. Medically known as chronic renal failure (crf), there is no cure for cats suffering from this disease.</p>

<p>Can kidney disease in cats be reversed? A cat with arf will require admission into the veterinary hospital for intravenous fluid support to correct rehydration, flush out toxins and balance electrolytes. Medications and supplements that lower blood pressure, raise potassium levels, lower phosphorous levels, promote kidney function, treat anemia, treat gastrointestinal ulcers, and reduce vomiting may all be a part of therapy. Be aware that not every cat in kidney failure will need every available treatment. This is especially true if the disease is caught early and intervention begins immediately.</p>
