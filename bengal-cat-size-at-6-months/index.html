<p>The bengal cat club notes that prices depend on the location, the breeder, gender, quality, and generation removed from the asian leopard cat. This is the size range for both male and female cats, though size can vary by gender. The bengal cat is a domesticated cat breed created from hybrids of domestic cats, especially the spotted egyptian mau, with the asian leopard cat (prionailurus bengalensis).the breed name comes from the leopard cat�s taxonomic name.

<p>Dob 2013 a clouded rosetted bengal kitten development stages. The bengal cat club notes that prices depend on the location, the breeder, gender, quality, and generation removed from the asian leopard cat. By six months, your 6 month old kitten should be around 6 pounds of weight. Bengals are larger so i would guess 8 lbs for a 6 month old. No rib bars, clear coat, gorgeous golden clouded outlined rosettes.</p>
