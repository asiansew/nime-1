So, if your cat is sneezing and coughing or has a fever or loss of appetite, it may well be suffering from cat flu. Humans cannot catch cat flu, and cats cannot catch human colds or influenza viruses. However, for more elderly animals, kittens, or cats with an underlying condition, it can be more serious.</p>

Luckily there are vaccinations available.</p>
