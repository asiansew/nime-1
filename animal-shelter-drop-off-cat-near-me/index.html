Please consider a sponsorship of a cat or dog in our shelter, any donation amount is very helpful, but listed below is what it costs for a sponsorship to help an animal with veterinary care. See fee schedule for current amount. Instead, they require pet owners to work with an intake. If you live outside these cities, we will accept your pet on a space available basis and charge $75.</p>

About 710,000 animals who enter shelters as strays are returned to their owners (620,000 dogs and 90,000 cats). Depending on the rules of your local shelter, you can sometimes drop your dog off at an animal shelter, but they may need advanced notice or to follow specific shelter procedures to do so. If the animal is owned by a person under the age of 18 years, that person’s parent or guardian is the animal’s legal owner.</p>
