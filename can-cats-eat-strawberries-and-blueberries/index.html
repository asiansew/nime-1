<p>Strawberries are a good source of vitamin c, potassium, fiber, and antioxidants. This being said, you should not give your cat blueberries too often, or give too many blueberries to your cat at a time. Since cats do not need to eat blueberries for survival, offering this berry to your cat is simply out of pleasure, as a treat, and on occasion only. Bring home a punnet of strawberries and your cat will likely show interest. Maybe your cat might not eat strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.</p>
