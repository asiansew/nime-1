<p>Sandstorm said, and gently licked his cheek with her tongue. Together, sandstorm and firestar leave skyclan and return home to thunderclan. Sandstorm and graystripe both think that firestar is going to tell them that he is going back to live with his twolegs to become a kittypet once again, and she asks him, devastated, how he can abandon his clan and herself just to go look for other cats. He gets his first apprentice cinderpaw who is caught in a trap by tigerclaw, which cripples her leg, making her yellowfang apprentice. Firestar is a ginger tabby tom with green eyes.</p>

<p>Firestar and sandstorm make it to skyclan�s camp, where they meet an old cat named sky, the last cat alive keeping skyclan�s memory. The two are still friends. Firestar is a ginger tabby tom with green eyes. When twolegs destroyed the forest, he led his clan on the great journey and helped them settle into the lake territories. Two kittypets named cherry and boris join the new skyclan, and get their apprentice names, cherrypaw and sparrowpaw.</p>
