String of fate, book 1 as bad days go, this one qualifies as one for the books. Cat’s cradle (1963) is vonnegut�s most ambitious novel, which put into the language terms like wampeter, kerass and granfalloon as well as a structured religion, boskonism and was submitted in partial fulfillment of requirements for a master�s degree in anthropology, and in its sprawling compass and almost uncontrolled (and uncontrollable) invention, may be vonnegut�s best novel. Edited by eugene wallingford <a href="mailto:wallingf@cs.uni.edu">wallingf@cs.uni.edu</a> now available on twitter at @booksofbokonon editor�s introduction.</p>
