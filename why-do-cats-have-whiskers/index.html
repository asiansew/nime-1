<p>Yes, cats have whiskers including their kittens, i.e., they have the longer ones or macrovibrissae on the side of their muzzle (the projected part of their face or snout) and shorter ones above their eyes (eyebrow like), on their chin and on their front legs. In addition to having sensory properties, a cat�s whiskers are also a good indicator of his mood. When the cat is happy, curious or content, the whiskers will be more relaxed and pushed forward. One answer to the question, “why do cats have whiskers” is simple: As you can see, a cat’s whiskers are extremely important.</p>

<p>The word ‘whisker’ itself arises from a latin word ‘vibrio’ meaning ‘vibrate’. The way they work is the whiskers pick up on air currents in a room, which then sends a message to their brain telling them where objects are. As you can see, a cat’s whiskers are extremely important. Biologists think mammals developed whiskers because they needed help sensing their environments at night. As we have seen, a cat’s whiskers are very special and necessary.</p>
