<p>Again, just like humans, some cats don’t have a problem digesting milk. This is a general rule for mammals, and cats are no exception. Why would you want to milk her in the first place? It can be bad for them. Cats, in fact, do enjoy music, but they don’t enjoy human music — at least according to new research.</p>

<p>Cats love the taste of milk because it is high in fat. Not only cats but most other carnivores when they kill a pregnant prey they will gorge themselves on the milk if possible. They will often choose to drink it even if it results in an upset stomach. Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few. I ve had my cat jenny now for six months shes eating fine a tin a day but i carnt get her to drink.</p>

<p>No really, the three i live with now (none are mine), none of them will eat meat, not chicken, not beef, not lamb, not even a mouse. Instead of milk, simply give your cat what it really needs: I have also lived with cats that don’t like milk, or even meat! Some cats become fond of drinking milk because drinking milk can make them feel comfortable, safe, and protected, like when they were little. Why do cats love milk so much?</p>

<p>Some cats like milk so much that when it is offered to them by their human parents they will drink a lot. It is a perfect match, well, at least in cartoons and movies. He would sit at the fridge in the morning waiting for it. Cats are very fond of cream, which they value for its high fat content, and so they are especially attracted to milk that has come straight from the cow, especially after the cream has been allowed to rise to the top. They also don’t like their water bowl extremely close to their food bowl.</p>
