<p>Snoring in cats may be a more common phenomenon than you think. So, why do cats cover their faces when sleeping? Cats spend an extraordinary amount of time snoozing. Lately it has been making sounds while sleeping,that my logic says it�s snorring. It’s also possible your cat is having a dream.</p>

<p>Like people, certain sleeping positions precipitate snoring. Some cats snore while they sleep. Cats in deep sleep are usually. The vibrations and snoring are most common when the tissues of the upper airways are relaxed while sleeping. If you hear your cat snoring once in a while, this is normal and not alarming at all.</p>

<p>It�s common for cats to nap, but only fall into a light sleep. If this is the case, the sound should be brief and stop when your cat changes positions. Light snoring or occasional snoring in cats is not necessarily a cause for concern, but snoring that starts occurring suddenly, snoring that is very loud or snoring that’s accompanied by difficulty breathing should be checked out by a veterinarian. Your cat may just be sleeping in odd positions that leads to temporary snoring. Just as human snores at times, so do all animals.</p>
