<p>Your kitty views your home as part of her territory, one that she must defend from any strangers coming into it. When the kittens were about 4 months old the mother started to be more aggressive towards them and now if she sees one within a few metres she will spit, hiss, growl and yowl angrily at it and even attack it. I have 2 outside cats and at first we only had the adult female cat. For example, my neighbors had a kitten that started coming to my house. My neighbor was not happy about it, but the little one was very stubborn and practically invited itself into my home. Not only does hissing convey aggression, a warning to stay away, but it also establishes social order between cats.</p>
<h3 id="otherwise-if-ignored-cats-will-have-to-attack-in-order-to-protect-themselves-their-kittens-or-territory">Otherwise, if ignored, cats will have to attack in order to protect themselves, their kittens, or territory.</h3><p>When a cat feels threatened, they’ll release a burst of air through their mouth, and it’s this burst of air that makes a hissing sound. To avoid fighting injuries to your cat, consider keeping her indoors. They do that in order to chase them away before they reach sexual maturity, otherwise they�d give their sisters and mother and aunt kittens, and they�d be weak and sickly and probably won�t survive. Like most mammals, mother cats are extremely protective of their babies. I had a cat for around 5 years. Felines will hiss as a warning, making humans and other animals aware that they should stay away from them.</p>

My neighbor was not happy about it, but the little one was very stubborn and practically invited itself into my home.</p>

<p>Now, that�s not to say that a mother cat will not hurt her kittens. Prevent the reunion for as long as you can. So, if you notice your cat hissing at you, it is giving you a warning that it is ready to attack if necessary. Primarily, mothers hiss so that kittens can learn to mimic the sound. It’s more likely that your cat is upset because of the new cat entering the home and they are in a mood.</p>

<p>The humane society says that cats have a wide variety of vocalizations that they use for communicating, both with other cats and with humans. It’s a common response to feeling threatened. Not only does hissing convey aggression, a warning to stay away, but it also establishes social order between cats. All cat owners have experienced the hiss of their cat at some point (probably more than once). When you observe your cat hissing especially the adults, one question that might cross your mind is why do cats hiss at kittens?</p>

<p>She isn�t abusing her kittens: All cats, and kittens even more rely on scent over sight when it comes to familiarity. Don’t take this personally, in my experience it’s really not the case. Also, those cats have about two litters per year with an average of four kittens, and. Cats also hiss at their kittens to warn them of an incoming threat.</p>

<p>Your kitty views your home as part of her territory, one that she must defend from any strangers coming into it. Sometimes, cats even hiss at the veterinarian because they don’t like being handled, poked and prodded — especially when that poking and prodding produces pain. A cat who is growling, hissing, or spitting is a clear sign that the cat is agitated, frightened, or angry about something. Your kitty views your home as part of her territory, one that she must defend from any strangers coming into it. A cat growling and hissing is usually a cat who�s scared.</p>
