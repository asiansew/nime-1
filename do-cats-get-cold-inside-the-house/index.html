<p>Bring stray/pet cats inside to prevent frostbite. As explained by science, a cat cools off while sleeping and maintains body temperature by eating. Use a heat lamp inside a pet house with blankets for your pet to lay on. When the thermometer dips below freezing, it is important to protect your cats from the cold spell. Feral cats want nothing to do with people, and coaxing them with food or treats is completely ineffective.</p>

<p>And one place they go to is inside the car bonnet near the engine! The first thing to know is that, in cold temperatures your cat will actually feel colder.although these animals prepare for winter by changing their fur, some breeds do have shorter and less dense coats (such as the persian, siamese, devon rex cats or the sphynx that has no hair at all) and will therefore feel the cold more and will require special care. Probably the best prescription for winter�s woes is to keep your cat inside with you and your family. If a cat approaches you and is willing to socialize with you, it’s probably an owned pet. In colder climates, they may also need the help of human caretakers to survive to spring.</p>

<p>Or if they get along fine, you can remove it and just have one huge open area. This is due to a few factors but primarily your cat’s coat. If your cat has streaming eyes and a runny nose, it will be concerning. Probably the best prescription for winter�s woes is to keep your cat inside with you and your family. The temperature that one cat prefers will differ from another.</p>
