I know that pork bones contain a greater source of nutrients more than other kinds of bones (except the rib ones). At food fur life and in our raw feeding for ibd cats group we often recommend pork loin as a starter meat when introducing raw food to cats. In the raw state, a virus could theoretically be transmitted via pork, which is fatal for dogs and cats. So the answer is that yes, cats can eat pork.</p>

<p>Talking with your vet about the cat food you provide and following the directions on the label will help ensure your cat�s diet is balanced and your cat stays healthy. It may not be toxic or dangerous, but it would rarely be described as a healthy meat. A cat’s nature is inscrutable, and we cannot assume if it starts to like eating pork, so any meat alone shouldn’t replace your cat’s regular diet since it doesn’t contain all the needed nutrients in the right amount. Cats require a higher protein level than most other animals , and as much as 60% of the calories in a cats diet can come from fat, high fat diets tend to produce obesity. Cat has eaten broken pork chop bones from the garbage.</p>

<p>Pork is a great meat for cats. We dont want to hurt the strays by giving them pork but they sure loved it. Most cats both love pork and do very well with it. Yes, pork off is perfectly okay for your dog to eat on occasion. So the answer is that yes, cats can eat pork.</p>
