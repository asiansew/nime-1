<p>The injury may be sudden and the result of a trauma such as a car accident or other major impact or after landing from a jump from an extended height, or it may be due to repetitive use of the joint causing minor ligament damage over time that has a cumulative effect. Now that we have discussed on similarity and differences in men and dog, the immediate question to pop up is whether down syndrome falls in similarity list or difference list. The injury may be sudden and the result of a trauma such as a car accident or other major impact or after landing from a jump from an extended height, or it may be due to repetitive use of the joint causing minor ligament damage over time that has a cumulative effect. As such, it�s physically impossible for cats to have a trisomy of the chromosome 21 pairing. With that in mind, you need to figure out what causes this problem if you want to get the very best results in the end.</p>

<p>According to a research article in the american journal of veterinary research published in 1975, state male cats can have a rare chromosomal abnormality because an additional chromosome produces a disorder. They might need a special diet, as well as a few more visits to the vet than most other cats. Meaning, it is a disease that won’t… Cats can have chromosomal imbalances and should be screened by a vet. The claim that some cats have down syndrome probably stems from the fact that there are cats born with unusual features, including slanted eyes, like kenny the tiger had, a flat nasal bridge, such as monty’s or a protruding tongue just like lil bub’s.</p>
