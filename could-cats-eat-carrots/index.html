<p>As i have said, cats can safely eat carrots and they would most probably find it delightful. Vitamin a in the average carrot, and good amounts of vitamins. Yes cats can eat bananas are they are not toxic, but cats do not require bananas as part of their diet and too much can lead to health complications. Both vegetables are safe and good with nutrition. This means they need animal protein to live, and carrots simply don�t meet that need.</p>

Carrots are not toxic to cats as they could eat this vegetable without issue. The issue with carrots and kitties all comes down to how the carrots themselves are prepared. Vitamin a in the average carrot, and good amounts of vitamins.</p>
