Now that you know why they do this, let me explain other reasons why they knead in this way. Cat suckling can be directed towards humans, with cat suckling on fingers or skin, or it can be done on fabrics (like blankets and towels).</p>

<p>However, even cats that stay in the same homes as their moms knead. An unspayed female cat will knead a blanket when she is coming into heat. It can be part instinct and part habit, and it will last his lifetime. I am not sure about cats who have mothers but in my experience cats who don’t have moms do this. Newborn kittens knead their mother’s belly as they snuggle close to nurse, and the motion is thought to stimulate the flow of milk through her nipples.</p>

<p>Cats have sweat glands on their paw pads that produce a unique scent. There are a few ways to answer the question, “why does my cat knead blankets?” explanations for why cats knead vary, but it is without doubt an instinctive trait. But why do they continue to knead past nursing age? One theory states that the instinct to knead stems from the wild ancient days of cats. Multiple theories exist that explain why cats knead.</p>

<p>As a result, the paws release a unique scent. As i grew up we used to have this weird habit of eating peanuts and shaking the salt off them. This spot is where the cat would regroup their strength and settle down to sleep. As a result, the paws release a unique scent. Cats have sweat glands on their paw pads that produce a unique scent.</p>
