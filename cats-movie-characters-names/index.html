<p>So, cat owners have many options for names to consider for their kittens. We have special categories for dogs, cats, exotic pets, and house pets. Remember mufasa and simba from the lion king? Male / female cats, or song / chorus cats, whether or not they have a named song. Disney makes some of the best children’s movies.</p>

<p>We selected 60 names based on dogs and cats from classic movies including lassie , lady and the tramp , the wizard of oz , and more. In addition to using names from disney cats, it also includes a few names from other characters that could also double as a cat name. Common themes in these characters include pet care, or the daily life of a cat from the cat�s perspective. Simba, the sweet lion from the 1994 film the lion king, is one of disney’s most popular characters of all time.as such, simba is perhaps the most popular choice for disney cat names. We are also proud of our free tools including a pet meme generator and a pet name generator.</p>
