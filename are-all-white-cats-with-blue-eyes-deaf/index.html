<p>Is that true, and why? Why are white cats with blue eyes usually deaf? However, some are just partially deaf, or just deaf in one ear. They have approximately a 20 percent chance of being deaf to some degree. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue.</p>

<p>I’ve also seen white cats with green eyes or gold eyes who are also deaf. White cats with blue eyes had a high probability. While 40% of white cats with blue eyes are deaf it still means 60% are not, so you should not assume a cat is deaf just because their eyes are blue and their coat is white. White cats can have blue, gold, green or copper coloured odd eyes. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf.</p>

<p>Many (but not all) white cats are deaf. An estimated 40 percent of white cats with blue eyes are deaf, which is high. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. Albino cats are not linked to deafness. Not all of these cats are deaf (see part 2 of this short article).</p>

<p>In one 1997 study of white cats, 72% of the animals were found to be totally deaf. People ask why white cats with blue eyes are deaf. You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate. It has to do with a genetic trait in all white cats. 65% to 85% deafness occurs if a white cat’s eyes are both blue.</p>

<p>Eye color in white cats also relates to the potential for deafness. Accordingly, white or lightly colored cats often have light eyes. A pure white cat with blue eyes has an 85 percent chance of some degree of deafness. Many (but not all) white cats are deaf. White cats with blue eyes are deaf even the ones with one blue eye and another different color eye are deaf in one ear.</p>
