<p>Your veterinarian can advise the specific quantity of pumpkin to serve, depending on your cat’s condition. Baby food is a great tool for cats. The answer is yes, cats can eat certain types of baby food in moderation. If your cat won�t eat plain canned pumpkin, mixing it with canned cat food or with a small amount of milk may be appealing. Cats perceive taste differently than dogs.</p>
