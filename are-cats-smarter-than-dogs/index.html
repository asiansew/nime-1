You want proof cats are smarter than dogs and to know if your cat is particularly brainy. Cats have different skill sets than dogs do but that doesnï¿½t mean theyï¿½re not as intelligent. Researchers in manchester, england looked into which animal is smarter, a dog or a cat.</p>

<p>Cat people are smarter than dog people. Dog lovers think dogs are smarter than cats, and cat lovers think felines are smarter than dogs. The current consensus among scientists and animal experts is that dogs are smarter than cats. In fact, cats do sleep more than dogs, which makes them a much calmer influence in a house, at least in my opinion. That also means dogs can learn commands, tasks, scents, faster than cats.</p>

<p>If we were to use the number of neurons or brain cells as the sole indicator of intelligence, then dog lovers would be able to definitively claim that dogs are smarter than cats. A study published in frontiers in neuroanatomy concludes that dogs may be the more intelligent species. Dogs are friendly, cats are smart. We know that dogs were domesticated long before cats were and dogs are easier to train and are sociable more than cats. But some scientists argue that brain size isnï¿½t the key to intelligence.</p>

<p>That also means dogs can learn commands, tasks, scents, faster than cats. The interaction of the cats with other animals as well as humans shows that the cats are smarter as well as they understand those. âiï¿½d bet the house that some cats are smarter than others. The twist in this video. Feline information on intelligence comparison remains sparse because, well, cats are unwilling to cooperate.</p>
