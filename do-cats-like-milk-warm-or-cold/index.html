Warm your kitten�s formula before feeding, especially if you prepare it ahead of time and refrigerate it. Milk intolerance, in spite of the customary image of a cat with its face in a dish of cream, cats must acquire a taste for dairy products.</p>

<p>Milk is bad for cats because most cats have lactose intolerance even if the milk is warm, it wont help. Although some cats obviously enjoy cow�s milk, many cats do not. While most people prefer drinking hot milk, some may also like it cold.hot milk is exposed to heat and may or may not change chemically and nutritionally, whereas cold milk has all the nutrients intact. Think of this as similar to when you’re picking a cozy beverage to curl up with. The most important is to keep your cat indoors.</p>

<p>Some cats prefer moving water rather than drinking from a bowl, so using a cat fountain may encourage her to drink more. As for warm or cold, kittens usually prefer warm milk but a cat will. Cold food or room temp food is fine. If you are giving it to a kitten, warm would be the answer to remind the kitten of its mothers milk. While milk might seem like a natural choice for your cat, the truth is that cow’s milk offers no nutritional value for cats, and it can cause digestive problems in many.</p>
