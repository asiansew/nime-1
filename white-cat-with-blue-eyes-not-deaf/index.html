Nevertheless, if she does not adopt her genetic color even after months of her birth, you should consult your vet. I had a gold eye white deaf rex kitten. Two blue eyes, completely deaf. If the eye color of the cat is completely white, then blue eyes in cats is highly unlikely.</p>

<p>They have approximately a 20 percent chance of being deaf to some degree. Not all white cats with blue eyes are deaf. Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. Unfortunately, if your cat is deaf, you will have to live with it. Surely there�s probably some exception to the rule, but the vet said this was the usual symptom for deaf cats.</p>

<p>White cat with two different colored eyes usually means deafness as is the case with my mom�s cat. Disorders of cats with blue eyes. Black cats with blue eyes. In addition, cats with albinism are susceptible to suffering from both deafness and blindness. While 40% of white cats with blue eyes are deaf it still means 60% are not, so you should not assume a cat is deaf just because their eyes are blue and their coat is white.</p>

<p>Deafness can also be caused by illness or injury, so a person adopting a deaf cat may not know whether the cat was born that way or became deaf later on. I had a gold eye white deaf rex kitten. Cats can be deaf in one or both ears. In cats, congenital deafness is seen almost exclusively in white coated individuals. Albino cats are not linked to deafness.</p>
