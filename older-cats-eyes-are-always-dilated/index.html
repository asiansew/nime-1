<p>I never see them with slits and they appear dull. To moisten and lubricate the eyes. Given the age of your cat i would evaluate her for pain, and treat appropriately. There may or may not be other symptoms present. If your cat’s eyes are wetter than usual, if it’s blinking a lot, or if there are often tear tracks on the fur around their eyes, that could be a sign that their eyes are watering.</p>

<p>Your veterinarian will refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist. The first thing we spotted was unresponsive pupils. Achy joints, hearing loss, deteriorating vision: If unequal pupils occur suddenly, bring your cat to a veterinary clinic or animal hospital immediately as eyesight can be permanently damaged if the problem is not rectified. My cats eyes look dilated, he seems somewhat.</p>

<p>Cat’s eyes will always dilate periodically. Cat’s eyes will always dilate periodically. Anyway i figured she belonged to someone because she was very fat or she was pregnant so i asked. That can be a normal sign of aging, or it can be a sign of serious disease. The pupil constricts or dilates (enlarges) according to the amount of light that enters the eyes, with both pupils normally dilating in dim light and constricting in bright light.</p>
