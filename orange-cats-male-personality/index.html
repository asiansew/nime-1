Orange cats were most often characterized as friendly. Orange cats are usually male. According to researchers at uc berkeley, all orange cats are considered tabbies and about 80 percent of all orange tabbies are male, so the majority of these are male orange cat names.</p>

<p>Orange cats were most often characterized as friendly. Up to 80% of orange cats are male and nobody knows why. Unlike other shy cats, these orange cats appear more comfortable in approaching humans. Long haired breeds such as persians, maine coons and american curl can have the orange tabby pattern. This is a really interesting fact and it tells us that sex and coat color genetics are somehow related, at least in orange cats.</p>

<p>Orange cats are visually appealing, but their temperament is determined by more than just coat color. Like being stroked, but dislike being picked up and cuddled.” a 1973 book published by pedigree foods described ginger tabbies as “quiet, docile and affectionate.” in a recent study at the university of california, cat owners were asked to attribute personality traits to their cats. Tortishell is a recessive gene on the x chromosome, so only females are torti and the males usually present as orange tabby. Although orange tabby cats are primarily male, female orange tabbies do exist in a ratio of about 80 percent male to 20 percent female, according to arnold plotnick, dvm. My wife, who grew up with lots of cats in her household, has always maintained that if you get an orange (or yellow/tan) male cat, it is much more likely to have a good personality than other cats.</p>
