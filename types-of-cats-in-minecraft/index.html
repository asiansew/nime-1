<p>In older versions of minecraft, you would breed ocelots to spawn a kitten. Once fed, hearts will appear, indicating the animal is ready to breed. Explore new gaming adventures, accessories, &amp; merchandise on the minecraft official site. Our list of minecraft pets below includes the most commonly tamed wild animals and a few of the more exotic ones that young players strive to attain. Some registries permit them to be pedigreed and they have been used as foundation stock in the establishment of some breeds.</p>

<p>The mob was created by taming an ocelot inside of the game. I love the minecraft cats and i had this same problem cause i wanted one of every breed. I have included a text document in the resource pack crediting you. Cats are mobs in minecraft and come a variety of colors. Cats are visibly smaller than ocelots despite sharing the same model.</p>
