<p>Via the contact form on the pact website. We have adoption centres up and down the country, find a cat or kitten in need near you. Disabled cats often find it harder to be homed, yet cats are remarkably adaptable when coping with a disability, and have just as much love to give. The risk of toxoplasmosis contracted from animal feces during pregnancy is still a major reason why many cats are put up for rehoming. Select dogs and/or cats, either gender or both.</p>
