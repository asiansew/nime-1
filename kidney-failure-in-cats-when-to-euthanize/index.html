Cats with behavioral problems are the most common example. Acute kidney failure develops quickly, usually as a result of an identifiable problem, such as getting into antifreeze, a kidney infection, low blood pressure during anesthesia, etc. However, the causes of kidney problem depend solely on the type of kidney failure in the felines.</p>

<p>You can treat kidney failure in cats to extend a cat’s life, but, unfortunately, a time will come when you have to let your cat go. Unlike acute kidney failure, chronic kidney failure isn’t reversible, but it is manageable. But some shelters are forced to euthanize cats due to a lack of facilities. When a cat�s kidneys are functioning at less than 15 percent of their capacity, that cat is said to be in renal failure. If the cat is diagnosed with stage 4 kidney disease, in most cases, the cat will have less than 2 months to live.</p>

<p>This disease can be caused by problems in various parts of the urinary system, either in the kidneys or in the areas before (prerenal kidney failure) or after (postrenal kidney failure). It becomes increasingly common with age. Acute renal failure develops suddenly, over a matter of days or weeks. This is because their kidney function often relies on drinking to flush toxins out of the system. When they stop eating, the end is not far way.</p>

<p>It becomes severe when the cat gets closer to their death. Following diagnosis to determine the cause, a number of tests need to be carried out. In such an instance, a vet will likely contact a shelter. A vet will only suggest that euthanasia is the most humane choice when: These are not in themselves a reason for euthanasia because many cats who are newly diagnosed, or cats who crash, have very high levels but pull through.</p>

My cat has very severe chronic renal failure/kidney failure and she has at most a year left to live. But some shelters are forced to euthanize cats due to a lack of facilities. However, there are many treatments and alternatives available before facing the decision to euthanize your pet.</p>
