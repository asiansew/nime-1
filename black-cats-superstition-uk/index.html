<p>Black cats are also believed to bring good luck in many ways. In fact, black cats are generally seen as good luck in. One of them was killed when he fell from a second floor. If the cat was seen following a female, then the cat could easily be thought of as a familiar, and the woman in question may face persecution as a witch. Black cats are witches in animal form as we previously touched upon, in medieval times it was actively believed that a black cat was, in fact, a witch disguising herself.</p>

<p>Even nowadays, some people in the countryside still think that there are evil spirits hidden in all black cats. In the uk (among others), october 27 has been designated as black cat day. Plucking a single white hair from black cat means that you will be lucky in love. National black cat day was created by cats protection on 27 october 2011 to help celebrate the majesty of monochrome moggies and beautiful black cats. There is also a black cat appreciation day on august 17th.</p>

<p>Since then, i hate seeing a black cat crossing my path. In the united kingdom, ireland and japan, a black cat crossing your path is considered to be a lucky omen. Black cats were associated with witchcraft. Over 40% of the cats taken in by cats protection centres are black, and these moggies can take 13% longer to find. In the uk (among others), october 27 has been designated as black cat day.</p>
