<p>You can feed your cats with apples paying attention. Cats are obligate carnivores which means they may not fully digest anything that isn�t meat. Other foods they love to eat are cat food, raisins, oranges, watermelon and etc. If you give them too much apples in may cause stomach aches and vomiting ad even diarrhea so moderate, then the amount is the best choice. However, be aware that apple needs to be prepared properly before cats can eat them safely.</p>
