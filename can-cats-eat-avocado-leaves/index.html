<p>When ingested, the toxin can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and pancreatitis due to its high fat content. The pet poison helpline lists avocado as mildly toxic to cats due to persin which is found in the leaves, bark and seed. So, adding a little bit of avocado to your cat’s diet is fine in moderation.if cats eat too much, they may get diarrhoea or vomit.as avocados contain plenty of folate, potassium, niacin and fatty acids, you may well notice that your cat’s skin and coat improve over time. Being aware of such symptoms are significant and necessary as you can save your cats in time. Do not give your rabbits avocado leaves or their skin as they are harmful and contain persin, which is toxic.</p>

<p>If your cat loves to nibble the leaves of plants you should be careful, since there are many varieties that can be toxic or poisonous, causing eye damage, dermatitis, digestive disorders, kidney, and even disturbances of the nervous system. The avocado is the fruit of the persea americana tree, native to central america and now cultivated in tropical climates around the world. However, like the leaves of many avocado plants, the pits can contain some nasty substances. Yes, cats can eat the ripe fruit of the avocado. Remember though, overconsumption of any food is not particularly good for you or your cat.</p>

<p>According to the aspca the only animal persin is toxic to is the horse where it can cause respiratory distress but cats are safe to eat avocados. When ingested, the toxin can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and pancreatitis due to its high fat content. However, much worry should be the avocado seed as it can block their esophagus or digestive tract if swallowed. Even though a small amount of the fruit is not enough to kill them, it is better safe than sorry. Some pet parents choose to give their cats products that are specially formulated with avocado, such as the cat food brand avoderm®.</p>

<p>That being said, due to the digestive system of cats which has adapted to eating meat, they won’t. The pet poison helpline lists avocado as mildly toxic to cats due to persin which is found in the leaves, bark and seed. The truth is avocado does have something called persin in it which is a toxin, but it’s not believed to be poisonous to cats. Pet birds, however, should never be fed avocado. Turns out, if your dog eats a little avocado (free of pits, skin, and leaves), there’s likely no real obstruction issue and no reason to panic.</p>
