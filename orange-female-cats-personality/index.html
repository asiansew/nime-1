<p>Orange cats can have long or short hair. In addition to being a real purr machine, momo the orange tabby cat seeks affection every waking. This finding suggests that orange cats may enjoy greater reproductive success in particular social conditions. Unlike other shy cats, these orange cats appear more comfortable in approaching humans. This means that there are more male cats with orange fur than female cats.</p>

<p>*this is because the “ginger gene” which produces the orange color is on the x chromosome. In the cat, the gene for the orange color is located on the x chromosome and is recessive. Unlike other shy cats, these orange cats appear more comfortable in approaching humans. This is determined by genetics. These are both nicknames that derive solely from the color of the cat, and it’s no wonder that these names were chosen.</p>

<p>This is determined by genetics. Wow, so that means my father for sure was an orange cat. Approximately 20 percent of orange tabby cats are female. Interestingly enough, most orange tabby cats are indeed male! This means that there are more male cats with orange fur than female cats.</p>
