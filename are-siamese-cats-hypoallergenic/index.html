So it’s not surprising that there is a high demand for hypoallergenic cats. However, they don’t like being left alone for extended periods. Since people assume hair is the issue, the hairless sphynx seems an obvious solution.</p>

<p>Siamese cats are among the breeds sometimes described as hypoallergenic. Contrary to popular belief, allergies that are brought on by cats are not caused by the cat�s hair shedding. Physically, there are no real features in this breed of cat that might make you suspect it will be ‘hypoallergenic’. It�s been said that siamese cats are hypoallergenic but this isn�t really true. In the 1900s, siamese cats participated in various cat shows and today, occupies the top place among short haired cat breeds.</p>

<p>“hypoallergenic” isn’t the right term. It�s not really possible to own a siamese cat, they�re much too independent for that. If you’ve experienced allergies to pets and worry that a siamese could trigger a response, you should be ok. Siamese cats cause less allergic reactions than other cats. Siamese cats are not hypoallergenic.</p>

The following breeds are considered to be some of the top hypoallergenic cats and are ideal for pet lovers that have highly sensitive allergies towards cats. Cats do produce pet dander, a common allergen, but the culprit for the estimated 10 percent of the population who are allergic to cats may be a protein, fel d 1, that is present in cat saliva.
