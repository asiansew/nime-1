<p>These root vegetables produce one of the best dietary sources of vitamin a and are also rich in fibre, vitamin c and b6, potassium, calcium and iron. Always ask your veterinarian before sharing human foods. Can my cat eat melon? They can be tempted to eat by slightly warming their food, offering foods that are tasty (due to high levels of protein or fat) or have a strong odour, and by offering variety, including new and different foods. Most cats are fastidious creatures and are careful about what they eat.</p>

<p>Also, remove the stems and leaves. Dogs can eat strawberries and most find them delicious! They are not harmful or toxic. Yes, dogs can eat watermelon, but the watermelon rinds and seeds (even the pale seeds in seedless watermelons) should be removed before giving the fruit to your. Dogs can eat strawberries, too — but only in moderation, and with the right preparation!</p>

<p>Always ask your veterinarian before sharing human foods. However, strawberries can be sprayed with toxic substances which can pose health risks to your pooch. When it comes to whether cats can eat strawberries, the short answer is yes they can. The only thing she can eat 24/7 with no issues is applaws chicken &amp; pumpkin. Dog bodies are different than ours, meaning they can eat some of the same foods we can, but need to stay.</p>
