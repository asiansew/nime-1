<p>Dry and wet cat food. Orijen�s food comes in a 12 lb bag, making it more cost effective compared to some of the other brands listed here. Sardines i estimate about 8/month. Yes, 78/month is a lot. The best cat food brands make their food in the united states, canada or new zealand.</p>

<p>Compare popular cat food brands, including royal canin, purina one, iams, james wellbeloved and whiskas, in more detail, including what members think of them. There are a few differences, which made me think it was worth making it into it�s own review. I must mention that orijen and acana (usa and canada foods) have. Ziwipeak is a relatively low profile brand at the moment however the new zealand based cat food company has a growing fan base and it is slowly taking over the u.s, britain and europe and definitely deserves a mention as one of the best cat. He is doing quite well.</p>
