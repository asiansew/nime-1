<p><strong>Do Cats Like Milk Or Water Better</strong>. Some cats, as in people, do not tolerate lactose well, for these animals, taking a plate of milk usually implies the least gastric problems,” explains veterinarian gina spadafori. If a cat chooses a puddle over fresh water, it often means there’s something wrong with the location, type of water, or the bowl itself. Well, it depends on your type of cat and sometimes it depends the time of the year. They are also often finicky about what they eat and drink, and they are sensitive to odors and tastes.</p>

<p>They will like the milk much better. The water bowls should be in an appealing place far from your cat�s food or litter box. There are cats that love milk. This can affect their water consumption because if they don�t like something about their water, they probably won�t drink it. Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few. However, these should only be fed in moderation.</p>

Kittens may need milk, but adult cats do not need to have it in their diets at all. Cow�s milk is different fro. You can offer small amounts as a treat. Cats who eat wet food will require less water, but you should always have it available for your feline friends no matter what type of food you feed your healthy cat. Some cats prefer moving water rather than drinking from a bowl, so using a cat fountain may encourage her to drink more.</p>

You may have heard that cats don’t like water. Plenty of cats have zero interest in interacting with h2o outside their water bowl, but there are breeds that are more likely to enjoy water than others.
