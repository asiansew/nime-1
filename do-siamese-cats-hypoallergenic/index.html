<p>It means that they produce fewer allergens. The rate of fel d1 secretion is lower than most of the cat breeds. Despite the long coat, siamese shed less and that is the reason it is often counted as a hypoallergenic breed. No cat breed is entirely hypoallergenic, but siamese cats are more so than most because they have short, fine fur. Siamese cats have been featured in popular films like the aristocats and lady and the tramp.</p>

<p>“hypoallergenic breeds do exist, and some even come in long hair,” says sasha gibbons, dvm at just cats veterinary hospital in stamford, connecticut. Siamese cats release less of the fel d1 protein that causes allergic reactions in humans. Often cat breeders and online sites claim that a particular cat breed is hypoallergenic, and this type of news spread fast. Are siamese cats hypoallergenic , the siamese was one of the original breeds of pedigreed cats. In fact, this usually very vocal kitty sheds much less than other cat breeds.</p>
