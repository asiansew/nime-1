<p>When a cat closes her eyes and opens them slowly, she’s saying she feels safe and relaxed enough to let her guard down. For a man dreaming of cats might represent a different meaning to that of a woman dreaming of cats. It reveals you are bound by your own fears or beliefs in various situations in life. This dream is positive because it represents you and the other people around you, meaning that you probably give other people your loyalty and your love and that they appreciate this in you. As you can see, dream dictionaries carry a wide range of possible interpretation.</p>

<p>Always try to remember the context of the dream, before you proceed to find out its meaning. You will have some failures soon. You are able to see the bright side of a negative situation. As you become more skilled at remembering your dreams, and thinking deeply about each element within the dream, you will learn to interpret what your dreams mean. If you dreamed you have cat eyes, such dream might indicate your ability to resolve some difficulties or problems.</p>

<p>Dreaming a cat without a body. An example of an balanced illusion is fantasizing about marrying someone you have a crush on, but hardly know. Eyes dream interpretation and meaning: Simply by using this unblinking stare,. They reveal parts of ourselves that may be hidden, such as visceral emotional responses or impulses that are unconscious, even if we are unaware of their presence in our waking life.</p>
