<p>Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. A pure white cat with blue eyes has an 85 percent chance of some degree of deafness. Whilst your cat is white with blue eyes and deaf it is not actually an albino. Furthermore, if a cat has one blue eye and one green, the ear on the side of the blue eye is more likely to be deaf than the other. If the cat in question has red eyes, however, then the chances of it having blue eyes in cats are quite good.</p>

<p>Of white cats with one blue eye, about 40 percent are deaf in at least one ear. Whilst your cat is white with blue eyes and deaf it is not actually an albino. 40 percent of white cats with one blue eye were deaf; In addition, a cat with blue eyes in cats would have a deformed, dead cat sitting on its chest and a deformed, dead cat with eyes just like the other. The w gene responsible for white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and presence of a blue eye can indicate the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located.</p>

<p>You can help a deaf cat lead a happy, full life by keeping it protected indoors and learning to use visual signals and vibrations to communicate. Furthermore, if a cat has one blue eye and one green, the ear on the side of the blue eye is more likely to be deaf than the other. To be a true albino he or she would have to have pink eyes and not blue. Deafness is far more common in white cats than in those with other coat colors. A white cat with one blue eye has a 39% chance of at least partial deafness, and a white cat with two blue eyes may have a 65% chance.</p>
