This means your cat will likely disregard them. They were curious are more likely to eat things they shouldn’t. Technically, strawberries aren’t toxic or poisonous to cats, but moderation is key, and you should really only be feeding strawberries to your favorite feline as an occasional snack.</p>

<p>They were curious are more likely to eat things they shouldn’t. So not only are strawberries safe for cats, they can actually eat and enjoy them in moderation. Strawberry is a fruit has bright red colour and juicy sweetness and has some nice texture. People who were little girls back in the 80�s might remember a little (highly merchandised) character named strawberry shortcake who lived in a giant strawberry shaped house and had a little pink cat with white polka dots named custard. Strawberries contain a lot of sugar, and a cat’s digestive system doesn’t necessarily process sugar quickly or efficiently.</p>

<p>According to the aspca, strawberries are safe to felines, dogs, and horses. Yet, despite being safe for your feline friends, you should give them sparingly as occasional treats. But the leaves could irritate your cat’s eyes, nose, or face. Can cats eat strawberries, sure. Felines can taste sourness, though.</p>
