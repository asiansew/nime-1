<p>Your cat�s pupils sound consistently dilated, which can be a sign of her losing her eyesight. My cat miss kitty usually follows along. Multiple health concerns are connected to dilated pupils. When i turned to check on miss kitty, i happened to look at her eyes and noticed that her right eye is completely dilated. However, if your cat’s pupils are dilated because of stress or discomfort, the situation should be assessed.</p>

<p>Our zebulon�s pupils never close to a slit like normal cat�s pupils do in bright light. Somehow his brain compensates for nystagmus. The pupil constricts or dilates (enlarges) according to the amount of light that enters the eyes, with both pupils normally dilating in dim light and constricting in bright light. If the pupils of your cats eyes are a different size then this is known as anisocoria. Although some of the causes that explain why a cat has round pupils are positive, it is important to note that this is sometimes not healthy.</p>
