<p>The little spotted cat is a wild cat species found in south america. Whether your kitty meows or roars, it is a descendant of the felis silvestris species, which is divided into the african wildcat, european wildcat and steppe wildcat. It is an agile and excellent climber and is able to descend head first from a tree or hang by one hind foot from a branch. Tica is the only organization to officially recognize the breed. This really puts the physical characteristics of a rusty spotted cat into perspective and gives you a fair idea as to how small they are when compared with a regular house cat.</p>
