<p>Bengals have a wild appearance; We intend to add data as time passes and also keep a history so savannah cat size may be tracked to see if generations are getting larger or smaller as time goes on. They are between 8 and 10 inches tall and are 14 to 18 inches long. With that being said, an average bengal female will weigh just under 10 pounds. If it is a small or medium breed, cat world estimates the weight potential as being between 8 and 13 pounds.</p>

<p>Many species exhibit some level of sexual dimorphism, where there is a noticeable size difference between males and females. We intend to add data as time passes and also keep a history so savannah cat size may be tracked to see if generations are getting larger or smaller as time goes on. For large breed domestic cats, the domestic relative(s) would be giving the bengal the genetic traits for a weight between 13 and 24 pounds. This is more evident depending on the domestic breed used as the parent of the bengal. The bengal cat club notes that prices depend on the location, the breeder, gender, quality, and generation removed from the asian leopard cat.</p>

<p>But, no matter what the color/tone, the pattern on a bengal cat should yield a high degree of contrast. They note $10,000 as one of the highest prices, and there are reports of a british woman paying $50,000 for a bengal cat. They are medium sized cats that can weigh between 8 and 10 kilos. The average male will weigh slightly higher, between 10 and 15 pounds. Since the asian leopard cat usually weighs between 13 and 15 pounds, a bengal will end up being right around the size of a large domestic cat.</p>
