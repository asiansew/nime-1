<p>When we first got our. Common complaints when an old cat meows all the time. They might be yowling at another cat or searching for a mate. It might be a good idea to have her checked out by a professional. The meowing is also kind of annoying since i�m studying for finals :( and i hope the cat isn�t in pain.</p>

<p>I thinks it sounds like a female cat? Since there are several reasons why cats meow, i thought i would cover a few of them. Cats more often than not vocalize for legitimate reasons but often it has to do with a need for attention. Finally, you can try and give them a perch to sit on to look outside. This may make you unpopular with neighbors.</p>

<p>Excessive meowing at night is the most common symptom, along with listlessness and uncoordinated movement. Yowling could be the sound of mating Your cat is announcing that she is available to anybody seeking a mate. And yes, they do meow very loud at times but this seems to be a behavior of the adult male cats only. Licensed veterinarian and certified cat behaviorist have helped cat owners get a good night�s sleep in over 30 countries since 1999.</p>
