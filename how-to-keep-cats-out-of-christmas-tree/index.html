And for lots of our feline, it means it is time to discover as many methods to debris with the tree as possible. Fence it off if your cats can’t be warded off, you may need to fence off the tree. A smaller tree will be better for cats if they do indeed end up climbing the tree.</p>

<p>Try wrapping the base of your tree with aluminum foil. Apple cider vinegar can also be sprayed as a cat repellant. This works the best although it could use more branches on it! Keep the tree away from launching zones (e.g., furniture) that your cat uses, in order to reduce the temptation to pounce on your tree. Christmas trees, whether real or artificial, can be a hazard for homes with pets during the holiday season.</p>

<p>I found one of my cats 1 time on the branch, he was scolded and it never happened again for 17 years. This will deter your kitty without leaving a noticeable odor to human noses. And for lots of our feline, it means it is time to discover as many methods to debris with the tree as possible. For a little rustic charm that will keep the cats away, tricia advises spraying a few pinecones with apple cider vinegar and placing them at the base of the tree. Christmas is getting closer and closer and most of us will probably have put up our christmas trees by now.</p>
