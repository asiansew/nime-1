<p>In addition to weekend dog adoption events, grand rivers humane society also has adoptable kittens and cats located at kitty korner (1649 main st. For some cats, the stuffed animal should be small enough to carry around. To keep your cat engaged and the toys novel, rotate your toys every few days, having just 3 or 4 toys out at a time and storing the rest. I lived with dogs in my last home.

<p>Soft stuffed animals are good for several purposes. For cats that want to “kill” the toy, the stuffed animal should be about the same size as the cat. Grab a cardboard box, some scissors, toys and treats.simply poke small holes in the box top, add kitty toys and treats to the box and put the lid back on. All you need is some extra scraps of fleece and a pair of scissors. This could include crinkle balls, fake mice, catnip toys, etc.</p>
