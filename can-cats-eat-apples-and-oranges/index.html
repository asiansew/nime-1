<p>Some fruits, such as strawberries and apples, can be safely given to cats in small quantities and are a great alternative to oranges. Apples are high in fiber and low in fat, making them an ideal fruit treat to give older cats and cats that are overweight. Then she would most likely get bad diarrhea and otherwise will start to vomit. Cats can get the same health benefits from apples as humans do. For the most part, the fruit is safe for the chickens to eat.</p>

<p>Cats can actually eat apples. Luckily, the essential oils are some of the lowest so oranges are the safest of the citrus fruits for cats. The flesh of apples is high in calcium, vitamin c, vitamin k, and pectin, and the skin is high in phytonutrients. There is no good that can come from your cat eating oranges so rather avoid it entirely. The fleshy fruit of apricots can make a good treat for cats and dogs.</p>
