However, in some rescue situations if the vet determines that we have done all we can with medical care and the cat or kitten would suffer, we humanely allow a veterinarian to help one of our rescues to cross the rainbow bridge (euthanasia.) Cat’s cradle rescue is a 501(c)(3) publicly supported charity. Yet animal shelters are filled with dogs and cats who must find homes.</p>

<p>So rather than buying a dog or puppy for sale from a dog breeder or buying a cat or kitten for sale from a cat breeder, we encourage people to adopt a dog, adopt a cat, adopt a puppy or adopt a kitten at their local animal shelter, spca, humane society or pet rescue group. All sites are nestled in the foothills of yangming mountain just outside. The local nonprofit cat rescue organization, the cats’ cradle, celebrated its 20th year anniversary in 2019. We almost always have a rescue cat or two looking for new homes. Daily 11.30am to 4pm, (closed tuesdays).</p>
