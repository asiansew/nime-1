<p>A funny and relaxed name for a feline.; All orange cats have stripe patterns, however faint. *this is because the “ginger gene” which produces the orange color is on the x chromosome. So, while all orange cats are tabbies, not every tabby is orange. Most orange cats happen to be male, but that doesn�t mean there aren�t still female orange tabbies out there!</p>

<p>The scientist says this ratio is alarming since the ratio is after every eight male there comes two females. Because the majority of orange tabbies are male, they exhibit typical male cat behaviors. The orange mutant gene is found only on the x, or female, chromosome. Although orange tabby cats are primarily male, female orange tabbies do exist in a ratio of about 80 percent male to 20 percent female, according to arnold plotnick, dvm. Is every orange tabby cat male?</p>
