There are many other members of this genus, such as african civets, which as their name implies are mostly found in central africa. According to world animal protection, the cats are poached from the wild and kept in cramped barren cages to produce gourmet coffee for visiting tourists.</p>

<p>Increasingly, civets are instead kept in cramped, unsanitary cages on coffee plantations. Civet coffee or kopi luwak as it is known in indonesia, is produced across the island of bali by civet cats. The worst part is people are buying it not knowing how viciously these animals are handled in order to produce this luxurious coffee bean. In the digestion process of the civet cats, the cherry goes through the digestive tract, only removing the skin and the pulp leaving the beans undigested. In essence, kopi luwak is the type of coffee bean processing which involves small animals called asian palm civet eating coffee cherries, digesting them and defecating them.</p>

<p>To help you truly appreciate the world’s most unique coffee, we compiled a fantastic list of the best cat poop coffee beans and grounds that you’ll. This coffee is real crap and being sold for $100 per cup. At my local specialty coffee bean store, it sells for $420 per pound—or $10 for a 10 oz. The type of coffee depends on the variety of beans the civet eats. It is produced from the coffee beans digested by civet cat.</p>

<p>Does cat shit coffee taste good? In most parts of the world excrement from wild animals is considered waste. The coffee bean is literally picked out of the poop of the cat (an asian civet) that eats the coffee berries. Kopi luwak is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which were eaten and defecated by the asian palm civet (paradoxurus hermaphroditus).it is therefore also called civet coffee.the cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected. Retail prices have reaches as high as $80 a cup.</p>

<p>But in indonesia, thailand and the philippines civet cat feces are seen as gold. Naturally, when the civets choose their meals they go for the ripest, plump cherries. Ridiculously expensive kopi luwak, or civet coffee, is brewed from beans swallowed and excreted by civets have been called “cruelty in a cup”. Civet coffee has more to do with the process it goes through, although many people prefer the flavor when it�s made from excreted arabica beans. But in indonesia, thailand and the philippines civet cat feces are seen as gold.</p>
