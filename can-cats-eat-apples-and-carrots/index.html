<p>Carrots are on the safe list for cats and can actually benefit their health, as well as their teeth. The answer to, ‘can dogs eat grapes’ is a firm “no.” Moreover, some of the nutrients in apples can pose some positive health benefits for your feline. That said, there are some precautions you ought to be aware of before you hand a slice of your granny smith over to your cat. Animal protein is the number one key to a healthy cat.</p>

<p>They are not picky eaters and won’t care if you feed them pink pearl’s, ambrosia, granny smith, empire, gala, and etc. Apples are rich in simple sugars such as sucrose, glucose, and fructose. Yet, keep in mind that your cat is a carnivore and needs animal sources of food. Moreover, some of the nutrients in apples can pose some positive health benefits for your feline. Dogs can eat lots of different fruits and vegetables, but just like apples, they should be fed in moderation.</p>

<p>Can my cat eat carrots? Most tortoise species can eat apples, and enjoy doing so. That said, there are some precautions you ought to be aware of before you hand a slice of your granny smith over to your cat. But, as like any type of “human” food that you give your cats, always give them in moderation every now and then. But many cats will eat carrots if offered.</p>
