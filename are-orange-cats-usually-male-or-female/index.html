<p>Names for female orange cats. This is a really interesting fact and it tells us that sex and coat color genetics are somehow related, at least in orange cats. Unfortunately, since male calico cats are born because of a genetic anomaly, they are often much less healthy than their female counterparts. However a female cat that is orange has to inherit the red factor from both parents whereas a male cat can inherit it only from the mother. Their coats come in 4 different patterns.</p>

<p>*this is because the “ginger gene” which produces the orange color is on the x chromosome. Unfortunately, since male calico cats are born because of a genetic anomaly, they are often much less healthy than their female counterparts. In the cat, the gene for the orange color is located on the x chromosome and is recessive. By red, we mean what is commonly. Most orange/ginger cats are male but i think it�s nearer 75%.</p>

<p>As we mentioned before, orange cats are usually very affectionate and affectionate so they usually fit very well within any family nucleus, however, in the case of females, this feeling of attachment usually grows considerably since they have their instinct maternal, so surely the orange cats will be more attached. To have black and orange in the same cat, the cat needs two x chromosomes. In comparison, female ginger tabbies have been reported as being “flighty”—so it seems that not all ginger tabby cats are known for their calm disposition. There is no monetary value, per se, associated with a female orange tabby cat. We have many female orange tabby cats in my practice.</p>
