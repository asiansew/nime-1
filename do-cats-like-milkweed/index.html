<p>Monarch caterpillars do only eat plants in the milkweed family (asclepias spp), so if we want to help them out in our wildlife gardens, we still need to add these plants to our gardens. All the bitty cats i took inside pupated but couldn�t fly, and were still on the butterfly weed the next day. There are many types of milkweed, and i happen to have two of them in my yard: “animals usually do not eat milkweed unless good forage is scarce or under conditions where plants freeze, etc. Hairy balls in full glory.</p>

<p>Monarch caterpillars (cats) eat the mlkweed plant. Additionally, as moarchjointventure.org notes, “deer and rabbits have been reported to eat milkweed leaves,” and good oak also mentions the same phenomenon and ads that. When the larvae emerge, they look nothing like the adult beetle. I like this assortment of 6 types of butterfly weed seed packets. He and his sister belleflower adore each other and do everything together.</p>

<p>The cats then eat the leaves. Chrystallis looks light at times during the day and dark changing, but never looks good to me. The new milkweed plants, if they are robust, rather than fine like seedlings, are likely shoots off root runners. Monarch caterpillars do not feed on tomato plants, despite what may seem like circumstantial evidence to the contrary. The usually solitary stems of milkweed grow 1 to 5 feet tall and bear opposite (sometimes whorled), sometimes fleshy leaves with entire margins.</p>
