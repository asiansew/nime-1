<p>The most common american myth is that a black cat crossing your path is a catastrophic symbol of bad luck, on par with walking under a ladder or stepping on a crack. Black cats are no more likely to change your luck than any other animal. In fact, unfortunate mass killings of black cats took place. And in germany, a black cat that crossed your path from fright to left signaled bad luck while a black cat that traveled left to right was a sign that better times lay ahead.

<p>One thing, however, that nikos absolutely did not believe in was superstition. Black cats are no more likely to change your luck than any other animal. In united kingdom and japan instead of being bad luck, it is good luck. In turkey, the bad luck can be reversed if at the moment you hold a part of your hair. In fact, unfortunate mass killings of black cats took place.</p>

<p>Black cats and luck — an overview. In japan, the “fortune cats” are small statues of a cat with raised paws. Black cats bring good luck—and bad. In germany it is a bad omen if the black cat crosses your path from right to left but it’s a good omen if it crosses from left to right. Black is the colour of night ( we do not say night is a bad luck).</p>
