(a tropine, tropicamide, morphine, clonidine, amphetamine) and plants (such as catnip) can cause dilated pupils in cats. I’ve never seen his pupils be in a skinny like my other cats, he always has them big and round. If your cat is on medication and has dilated pupils, contact your veterinary surgery who will be able to advise if this is a common side effect. She has been on antibiotics for almost three months off and on.</p>

<p>His eyes look sort of cloudy, but it�s not cataracts. The reason that the eyes are dilated is because your cat is effectively blind. I know that i read that most cats with blue eyes are either blind or deaf or both. These drugs affect the muscle that widens the pupil, slowing how it reacts to light. It only becomes a concern if the pupils never contract.</p>
