<p>People who handle an infected cat or an infected cat�s bedding, food, or water dish can carry the virus to the next cat they handle. Are cats susceptible to parvo? Fortunately, vaccination protects dogs from getting sick which is why it’s mandatory for all puppies! Can cats get parvo from dogs? Canine means dog and no other mammal, besides a dog can get it.</p>

<p>Pet dogs and cats can get infected with other parvoviruses that do not infect humans. In other words, canine parvo cannot spread to cats. So yes, cats can get parvo if they are exposed to feces of an infected animal. A human or other animals, if in contact with infected feces, can spread it to other animals. Not everyone has that kind of money.</p>
