<p>Essentially no, the balinese cat does not shed a lot, which may come as a surprise when you see their coat. Cat lovers who suffer from allergies can still have cats, but they have to look for the hypoallergenic ones. We have all of the information you need to know about balinese breeders including website url, contact information, facebook page, memberships to associations, and more. I am looking to add a new member to my family. Keep scrolling to find out more.</p>

<p>If you want a cat that interacts with you now and then, javanese would be the right option for you. The balinese cat breed is an active cat breed that demands your attention and affection. If you live in new york city and are hoping to adopt from us, check out the cats available at our adoption center. A protein (fel d1) is the allergen in the cat’s saliva is what causes problems for cat allergy sufferers. In the 1940s, some people eventually thought these cats might be a good addition to the existing cat breeds.</p>

<p>I also raise sheltie dogs. A siberian does best when given plenty of playtime, training and attention. Our goal is to help you locate the perfect cat breeder near you; I live near harrisonburg, virginia, and began raising purebred siamese over 45 years ago. Often referred to as the “longhaired siamese,” the balinese looks like an unlikely candidate for a hypoallergenic cat breed.</p>
