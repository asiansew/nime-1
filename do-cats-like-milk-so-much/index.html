<p>Moreover, we do know cats, like all animals, have feelings, because when they get hurt they cry out in pain, when they are sick it shows in the way they act, so just maybe they have other feelings. So, just like humans who are lactose intolerant, giving an adult cat milk can lead to stomach upsets. A small amount can be used as a treat, something to give your cat as a reward or as part of holiday cheer. Much more research needs to be done in order to fully understand cats, and the research done so far has just been the tip of the iceberg so to speak. Vets are much more concerned with the amount of water, carbohydrates, and proteins consumed by your cat.</p>

<p>In nature, there is little chance of them getting a lot of milk once they are no longer a kitten, so evolution didn�t include an off switch to kill liking milk after they grow up. Some cats prefer moving water rather than drinking from a bowl, so using a cat fountain may encourage her to drink more. The milk we now buy in supermarkets contains little fat, and while some cats may like it for its taste, many do not find it easy to digest, dr. Because cats are such smart, sentient creatures, they can have a long list of likes (and, perhaps, an equally long list of dislikes!)!) in most cases, the things your cat loves are the very same things you love—like fresh, tasty food, long naps in cozy spots, and plenty of fun activities, to name a few. Three reasons why most cats don’t like the water.</p>

<p>Cats like milk because it is rich in fat. Some keep making lactase into adulthood, particularly if they’ve been fed milk continuously since weaning and so their bodies have continued to produce lactase, and they can tolerate milk. There’s also no denying that milk is a natural part of the feline diet—when it comes from mom. Learn why cats have a thing for drinking milk. Today’s topic is, why do cats like milk so much.</p>
