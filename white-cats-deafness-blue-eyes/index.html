<p><strong>White Cats Deafness Blue Eyes</strong>. There is a gene/gene complex which causes white coat, blue eyes and deafness, but not all cats get their white coat and blue eyes from that particular gene, so not all white cats will be deaf. Some of these breeds only ever have. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises.</p>

<p>A cat with a gene with white spots (like the tuxedo cat) can have blue eyes or in some cases odd eyes. White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. However, the prevalence of white cats does vary in different geographies. However, there is no need to be feared to bring a cat with blue eyes home because more than 50 percents of cats who are not pure white, their blue eyes are not always related to deafness and blindness. Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises. When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes.</p>

<p>The same genetic factors that give white cats their snowy coats and unique eye colors can also cause total or partial deafness in many kitties. Hereditary deafness is a major concern in white cats, and even more so if one or both irises are blue in color. Pointed cats, like siamese, who have a lighter body and darker extremities, always have blue eyes. Deafness is more likely to occur in white cats with blue eyes; There is a gene/gene complex which causes white coat, blue eyes and deafness, but not all cats get their white coat and blue eyes from that particular gene, so not all white cats will be deaf.</p>

From what i read, pure white cats, specially with blue eyes are very likely to be deaf, amost 80%. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance.

<p>Hereditary deafness is a major concern in white cats, and even more so if one or both irises are blue in color. If a cat with odd eyes is deaf, it is always on the same side as the blue eye. Meantime, the same defect often also affects a cell layer of the inner ear that is essential for hearing. When the white spot gene affects both eyes the cat will have blue eyes. White kitten with blue eyes are often be associated with blindness and deafness.</p>

<p>White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. Meantime, the same defect often also affects a cell layer of the inner ear that is essential for hearing. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear. The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes.</p>

<p>This masking gene is also sometimes responsible for blue eyes in white cats. So if the cat has blue eyes, it is more likely to be deaf, and if it has only one blue eye, it maybe deaf on only that side, and the cochlea in the ear on the other side will have developed normally. Studies have shown that solid white cats with two blue eyes have 65% to 85% chance of being deaf. A cat with a gene with white spots (like the tuxedo cat) can have blue eyes or in some cases odd eyes. From what i read, pure white cats, specially with blue eyes are very likely to be deaf, amost 80%.</p>

<p>Photography by belinda pretorius / shutterstock. The vet saw them with about 3 weeks, they are now about 4. Congenital sensorineural deafness occurs in domestic cats with a white coat. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. Albino cats are also incredibly sensitive to prolonged and intense sun exposure.</p>
