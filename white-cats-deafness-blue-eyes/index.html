Deafness can occur in white cats with yellow, green or blue irises, although it is mostly likely in white cats with blue irises.</p>

<p>White cats need to inherit a particular gene or gene complex to be diagnosed deaf. Meantime, the same defect often also affects a cell layer of the inner ear that is essential for hearing. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. It is a congenital deafness caused by a degeneration of the inner ear. The chance of deafness is as high as 80% in a white cat with 2 blue eyes.</p>

<p>This masking gene is also sometimes responsible for blue eyes in white cats. So if the cat has blue eyes, it is more likely to be deaf, and if it has only one blue eye, it maybe deaf on only that side, and the cochlea in the ear on the other side will have developed normally. Studies have shown that solid white cats with two blue eyes have 65% to 85% chance of being deaf. A cat with a gene with white spots (like the tuxedo cat) can have blue eyes or in some cases odd eyes. From what i read, pure white cats, specially with blue eyes are very likely to be deaf, amost 80%.</p>

<p>Photography by belinda pretorius / shutterstock. The vet saw them with about 3 weeks, they are now about 4. Congenital sensorineural deafness occurs in domestic cats with a white coat. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a gene that is responsible for deafness as well as for blue eyes and to establish a plausible mode of inheritance. Albino cats are also incredibly sensitive to prolonged and intense sun exposure.</p>
