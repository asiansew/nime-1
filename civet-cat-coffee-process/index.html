<p>Kopi luwak is a coffee that consists of partially digested coffee cherries, which were eaten and defecated by the asian palm civet (paradoxurus hermaphroditus).it is therefore also called civet coffee.the cherries are fermented as they pass through a civet�s intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected. After the civet excretes the berry in its feces, humans collect the dung, which is then washed so as to extract the berries, which are then ready for roasting and preparation as a beverage. Passing through the digestion tract of the catlike civet.the civet cat eats ripe coffee cherries and, after it has digested the fruity pulp, excretes the coffee beans. The risk to human health is at stake. During the digestion process the coffee cherries and the pulp are removed but the coffee beans are not digested.</p>

<p>The coffee separated from its faeces is processed to make the kopi luwak. The whole process starts while the civet cat looks for food and end up eating the cherry on the coffee tree grown wildly or in the coffee plantation. To be created, a civet must consume coffee beans, and the beans must pass through the animal’s digestive track. Palm civets, also known as civet cats, are. The civet selects the ripest berries of the coffee plants from the old robusta coffee plants and eats the whole fruit.</p>

<p>How kopi luwak coffee is digested. However, its processing is very unusual. For experienced coffee lovers, however, it’s a different story. A civet (/ ˈ s ɪ v ɪ t /) is a small, lean, mostly nocturnal mammal native to tropical asia and africa, especially the tropical forests.the term civet applies to over a dozen different mammal species. During the process, the pulp will be removed and digested, but the bean will remain the same, and fermentation occurs.</p>
