<p>As it gets many cats amped up, catnip is a great way for your indoor cat to get a little bit of the exercise they need. When asked this question, we always answer, “as far as we know, but there could be exceptions.” the truth is that nearly every cat reacts well to catnip, but there’s always a chance that some cat could have an. In fact, the effects are very similar to that experienced by humans when drinking it as tea. Catnip is not the sole reserve of felines.

<p>If you know something is on the horizon that is likely to stress your furry friend out (like a trip to your vet), then a common recommendation is to let your cat play with some. Lots of cat toys are stuffed with catnip. Many people remember a south park episode where cartman�s kitty throws a wild party and the catnip is treated like cocaine by all the hard partying cats.(“no, kitty, that�s a bad kitty!”) Never offer a cat hot tea. In fact, catnip can even be safely ingested by humans (especially when the dried leaves are made into a tea).</p>
