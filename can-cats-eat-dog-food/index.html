So while a bite of dog food is generally considered to be safe for cats, it can’t give your feline friend all of the nutrients she needs. Garfield (likely only teasing) claims that dog food has yak lips, lizards, caterpillar fuzz, duck feet, aluminum siding, chewed gum “and some stuff you wouldn�t even want to know about!” odie looks a little ill. In addition, the improper balance of proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals may cause gastrointestinal upset in your cat if she eats a large amount of dog food.</p>
