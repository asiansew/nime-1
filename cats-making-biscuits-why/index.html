<p>Cats’ kneading is pushing his or paws alternately on a soft or squishy surface (e.g. Jasmine,the cat, is banned from my daughter�s room, because she kneads on her only when she�s asleep, and always does that on her bottom(i think the diaper is the target). It’s also possible cats knead to mark their territories. Many will purr contentedly, zone out, and even drool. So wise and so focused.</p>

<p>Cats aren’t too picky when it comes to choosing where they want to make muffins. Jasmine,the cat, is banned from my daughter�s room, because she kneads on her only when she�s asleep, and always does that on her bottom(i think the diaper is the target). In kittenhood, kneading stimulates the mother cat’s milk while nursing. It’s also possible cats knead to mark their territories. It’s a common cliché that cats enjoy chasing a ball of wool.</p>

<p>Not only that, it is a way for cats to show their comfort and happiness when being on your side, but it is also seen as cats’ to show love to you, their owner. It�s not completely clear why cats like to give these kitty massages, though. Many will purr contentedly, zone out, and even drool. Sometimes, making biscuits could be an extension of a really good stretch. Kneading (making muffins) is the thing that expresses happiness, comfort, and a sense of security in cats.</p>
