<p>Voted awesome and voted up. Source to get down to brass tacks, “calico” is not a breed of cat. Natures47friend from sunny art deco napier, new zealand. Auckland roadmarkers are experts in the line and road marking of car parks, factories, warehouses, shopping centres and schools all throughout auckland. The young are a similar colours but are normally paler with dull colours for the beak, eyes and feet and they have a shorter tail.</p>

<p>Calico cats are some of the coolest cats there are. As you are driving you’ll see reflective road studs marking the road. When it comes to using roads, we are all in this together. The colour pattern on new zealand roads is white or yellow cat�s eyes along the centre of the road (yellow indicating overtaking is not permitted) and red dots along the hard shoulder or left edge of a motorway. We had 3 cats killed on that road and one badly injured.</p>
