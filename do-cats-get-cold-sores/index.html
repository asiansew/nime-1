<p>So i took him to the vet. Do cats get cold sores? These are part of the eosinophilic plaque complex, and currently are believed to be related to allergy. I have a male cat about 6 years old. So if you pat a cat with cold sores and then pat your own cat, you could spread the virus to your kitty.</p>

<p>Can dogs get cold sores? Cats don�t get cold sores like people do. Cats weakened by the virus may also develop secondary infections. They are caused by the feline herpes virus and can affect any cat during any point in its life. You can easily get rid of acanker sore using home remedies, but it is different from a cold sore.</p>
