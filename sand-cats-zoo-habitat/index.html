Habitat • in the wild: The san diego zoo safari park has an ocelot living in our condor ridge habitat, and a caracal and servals that help us as animal ambassadors.

<p>The sand cat is one of the world’s smallest feline species, weighing 4 to 8 pounds and measuring about. Sand cats will also cover large kills with sand and return later to feed. Our zoo has the world�s largest group of arabian sand cats. Desertification, loss of vegetation and habitat degradation along with persecution in retaliation for killing chicks have put them at risk. We have been very successful in breeding and maintaining this species by launching a new project that focuses on breeding and releasing sand cats in their natural habitat.</p>
