<p>The organisation was founded as the cats protection league on 16 may 1927 by jessey wade, at a meeting in caxton hall, london. Spaying cats, especially if it’s done when they’re young, greatly reduces the risk of them getting breast cancer and infection of the womb (called pyometra). We recommend cats are neutered at 4 months old as this is the age when they can get pregnant. The guide dogs for the blind association (uk). Getting your female pet neutered in one of the kindest things you can do.</p>
