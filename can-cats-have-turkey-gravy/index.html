<p>Using friskies extra gravy chunky cans (turkey, chicken, and salmon) i separated the gravy from the chunks by pressing the mixture through a strainer using a bowl bottom. The main reason to discourage feeding cats people food is that there are a number of foods that are toxic to cats. Extra gravy adds extra yum to every bite.caloric content: Human foods are not meant for cats. Turkey should be fed moderately.</p>

<p>I was thinking of letting them enjoy the sunday roast experience, would chicken and bisto gravy be fine for them to eat? Tuna has too much unsaturated fatty acid and does not have sufficient vitamin e or other antioxidants, whereas commercial cat foods usually supplement vitamin e. On average, an adult cat can have a maximum of 1 ounce of cooked turkey meat at a time. Yes, you can give your dog some turkey meat and even a little gravy. Some cats have the habit of just licking the gravy and leaving the meat behind.</p>

<p>Cats can eat turkey, but make sure that the turkey you feed them is cooked and fresh. So, it’s not wrong to say that gravy is the tastiest part. Gravy can also contain additional ingredients toxic to cats. Even if you have a cat (who typically eat more carefully than dogs who usually inhale their food), you can still get into trouble with bones. Not all cats like gravy, but for those that do, you can give them something like lotus’ canned stews.</p>
