<p><strong>Big Cats Hybrid Species</strong>. A panthera hybrid is a crossbreed between any of four species—tiger, lion, jaguar and leopard—in captivity.

Though this kind of species and breeds crossing does not usually appear in nature, with the intervention of humans, we now have zonkeys, ligers, and savannah cats. A popular hybrid, savannah cats are taller than typical house cats and look like small cheetahs.</p>

<p>Although hybrids are still controversial, there is no denying how unique and beautiful they are. Where big cat species have overlapping territories, they usually have different lifestyles and rarely meet. A tigon is a hybrid cross between a male tiger (panthera tigris) and a female lion (panthera leo). Most, like the margay, are relatively small. Unlike lions who sleep and roll around for 90% of their entire lives, jaguars are more active and are spending their time hunting cooler prey. Though this kind of species and breeds crossing does not usually appear in nature, with the intervention of humans, we now have zonkeys, ligers, and savannah cats.</p>
