Brown rice is the most nutritious source of rice, though white rice offers good digestibility for cats with sensitive stomachs. If your cat enjoys pumpkin, the best way to serve it is straight out of the can. Can cats eat banana bread. None of these ingredients are particularly harmful to cats in small amounts.</p>

<p>You just don’t want to feed it as a main staple to your cat as it doesn’t have many health benefits. Make sure that you do not feed them with this food frequently. And yes, cats can and love to eat bananas. You’ll want to buy the pure, cooked, pureed canned pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling with sugar and spice and everything nice) and start your cat on it by adding 1/2 teaspoon to your cat’s wet food once per day to see how he does. A canned pumpkin that is low in sugar is unseasoned, mashed and pureed is safe to feed cats.</p>
