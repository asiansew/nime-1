The only time meowing may be a form of communication between cats is when cats in heat meow loudly to get a mate�s attention. Yes, you read that right: A stray cat can find it difficult to find food, warmth and optimal conditions for its development.if this cat was abandoned or was born in the streets, it could be that he is cold, hungry, thirsty or very frightened.</p>

<p>Although you may find excessively loud meowing to be annoying, it may also be an indication that your cat isn�t feeling well. Some cats are simply more vocal than others. If the meowing is a new behavior, a trip to the vet is probably a good idea. Sometimes though, meows simply serve as a “welcome home” salutation. Meowing comes in many variations, and each one means something slightly different.</p>

<p>In other words, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Sometimes though, meows simply serve as a “welcome home” salutation. The many reasons for the cats� meow: Cats that have not been spayed may yowl because they are in heat. My cat is in heat and won’t shut up.</p>
