<p>Watery eyes, just like in humans, can mean that the eye is dry, which is easily resolved with eye drops. Some cats are born without a proper tear drainage system or misshapen eyes, which can lead to runny eyes. Cats can be allergic to a variety of substances, such as pollen, dust, mold, chemicals or foods. Excessive cat eye watering can be caused by allergies, a foreign body in the eye, or even the shape of the cat’s face. You may know it by its nickname, pinkeye.</p>
