You might wonder how long does a cat stay in heat especially since the odd behavior as well as the yowling may disturbed you. They can come into heat every two to three weeks, for seven to 10 days, beginning in early spring and winding down in late autumn as the hours of daylight decrease (a cat needs at least 12 hours of daylight for a normal cycle).</p>

<p>Some cats are very late bloomers only reaching sexual maturity at a year old. After this, the female cat may go back into heat. They can come into heat every two to three weeks, for seven to 10 days, beginning in early spring and winding down in late autumn as the hours of daylight decrease (a cat needs at least 12 hours of daylight for a normal cycle). This includes an active heat that usually lasts from several days to a week, followed by a “rest” period of 1 to 2 weeks. But while the length of the cycle is pretty standard, the frequency can be a bit harder to pin down.</p>
