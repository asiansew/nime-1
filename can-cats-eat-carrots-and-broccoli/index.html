As we know a cat is carnivorous , and therefore it would not cross our minds to feed it vegetables. Cats don�t require fruits and vegetables to balance their nutrition. In fact, many cats love carrots.</p>

<p>Are they safe for cats to eat? In general, with broccoli, you are helping your finicky cat get healthier. Warding off of free radicals. If you�re thinking of adding fruits and vegetables to your cat�s diet, you�re probably wondering which foods are safe to feed him. In fact, broccoli is completely safe for cats to eat.</p>

<p>But, overfeeding will show the opposite result. However, vegetables are not part of a cat’s natural carnivorous diet. Instead, feed them plain broccoli. This is the sort of food that rabbits were made to eat and when combined with a lot of hay and a diet rich in healthy pellets, it makes for a complete nutritionally sound profile. Fat cats are no joke, and we know responsible pet owners like you are doing all you can to help keep your cat as healthy as he can be.</p>
