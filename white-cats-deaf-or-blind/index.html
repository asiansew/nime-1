<p>One of the most significant things that is associated with coat color in dogs is the fact that the color of your dog’s fur predicts the likelihood that your dog�s hearing will be normal or not. White cats with blue eyes are deaf, not blind. And she was not deaf, much to my surprise! Not all of these cats are deaf (see part 2 of this short article).

<p>It was love at first sight and i adopted her, had her spayed and had her for over 12 years. Blue eyed cats are more often deaf than white cats with other coloured eyes. If 40 percent of these cats are deaf, it means the majority (60 percent) can hear. There is no truth that white cats with blue eyes are blind. However, among pet cats it is much more common to find white cats, probably simply due to selective breeding (human preference and intervention).</p>
