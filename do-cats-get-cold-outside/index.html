Cats can feel the cold just as much as you and i cats always feel so warm to the touch when we stroke them, but do they feel the winter weather like we do, or do they ever get cold? When it is too cold for humans to sleep outside, then it is also too cold for feral cats or stray cats.</p>

<p>The wet blankets freeze, and this means the freezing cold gets transferred to the cat. Check your car before you start up the engine to avoid your cat getting injured Cold weather can be hard on cats, just like it can be hard on people. If you have an outdoor cat it can be difficult to get them to want to stay inside during the cold. Older cats over 7 years old have weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>If your cat is an outdoor cat then it is important to know and have an understanding of what temperature can your cat tolerate outside, especially in winter. Similarly to humans, some cats may feel the cold more than others. Get your own cat microchipped and encourage your friends and family to do likewise. One important factor to bear in mind is to keep windows closed, as well as doors, to avoid a cold stream of air from passing through the house. Letting your cat outside when itâs cold âif you canât go outside in a regular jacket then your cat shouldnât.</p>

<p>Your catï¿½s fur coat only really works when itï¿½s dry. âonly the sickest and most exposed animals are seriously at risk, as long as temperatures remain above freezing (32Â°f). If your catâs fur gets matted from being wet or snowy it canât trap heat among the hair filters like it should. Many cats tend to be chronically dehydrated, and winterâs chill can make it even more difficult for feral or outdoor cats to get access to water. Cats often find shelter from extreme weather, such as heavy rain or snow.</p>

<p>When it is too cold for humans to sleep outside, then it is also too cold for feral cats or stray cats. We must provide them with extra protection against the cold. Cats trying to shelter from the cold often crawl into car engines where there is some warmth left over from when the car was last driven, so check underneath before you drive off. Itâs easy to do with the right items. If the cat starts sneezing too, it will become clear that is has caught a cold.</p>
