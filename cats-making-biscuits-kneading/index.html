<p>Kneading the area to tamp down grass and brush and get rid of unwanted pests before lying down is an ancient instinct. If you’re curious to learn more about your cat’s behavior, let’s dive deeper into why cats knead and what this adorable habit of “making biscuits” may indicate. Kneading is also called making biscuits because the action resembles someone kneading dough. The cat will push out and pull in their front paws, often alternating between right and left limbs. Usually it�s combined with plenty of purring and possibly drooling.</p>

<p>If you’re curious to learn more about your cat’s behavior, let’s dive deeper into why cats knead and what this adorable habit of “making biscuits” may indicate. That�s why we see adult cats making biscuits when they find a soft blanket or fresh, clean laundry. It’s not uncommon to hear purring while this happens. Kneading is when a cat moves his feet back and forth rhythmically, kneading some invisible dough with his paws as he purrs away happily. “kneading is a behavior that most cats will continue to do throughout their lives,” krieger says.</p>

<p>It all starts with instinct! By jennifer sellers, petfinder contributor. Whatever you may call it, the adorable and somewhat baffling cat behavior of kneading often leaves many cat owners scratching their heads. It�s also called padding, paddling and pushing. whatever it�s called, it�s no cause for alarm if a cat does it constantly. One theory on kneading is that it’s a natural behavior passed down from their wild ancestors.</p>
