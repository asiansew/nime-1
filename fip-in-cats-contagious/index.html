<p>Feline infectious peritonitis (fip) is a complex, serious, and ultimately fatal disease of cats, caused by a biotype of feline coronavirus (fcov), called feline infectious peritonitis virus or fip virus (fipv). It occurs worldwide in cats of all ages, but the disease is most common in young cats less than two years of age. Kittens and cats under the age of 3 are at greatest risk for fip. Prior to february 2019, feline infectious peritonitis was a guaranteed death sentence to cats. Chronic bronchitis in dogs is neither infectious nor contagious.</p>
