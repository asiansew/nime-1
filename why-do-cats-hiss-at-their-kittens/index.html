<p>Cats do not like change. When you observe your cat hissing especially the adults, one question that might cross your mind is why do cats hiss at kittens? Kittens are altricial, which means they are extremely immature and helpless for the first few weeks of life, unlike a horse who is precocial, which means they are born in an advanced state and can walk soon after birth.altrical species are completely reliant on their mother and unable to protect themselves from danger. This could be brought about by an oncoming stray cat or stranger. She would give birth to her young ones and take care of them but, after few months, she would start hissing at them.</p>
