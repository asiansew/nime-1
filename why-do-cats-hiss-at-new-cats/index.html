<p>Don’t take this personally, in my experience it’s really not the case. It’s a defensive behavior that often means you’re doing something your cat doesn’t like. While many people believe that hissing is done out of aggression or hatred, cats most often hiss to express fear. The list of things that cats see as dangerous is a long one: Growling and hissing are both very common ways that cats communicate.</p>

<p>Rescued cats can hiss due to fear. Sometimes, cats even hiss at the veterinarian because they don’t like being handled, poked and prodded — especially when that poking and prodding produces pain. You have to handle such situation patiently. Read on to find out how and why cats hiss and what you should do when they hiss at or around you. When a cat feels threatened, they’ll release a burst of air through their mouth, and it’s this burst of air that makes a hissing sound.</p>

<p>How cats learned to hiss and why they do it now. The answer comes from desmond morris, a well known british zoologist. If you are a cat owner and decide to introduce a new kitten to your household, you are almost certainly hoping your cat will take to the change well and that the two will become friends. It�s never quite explained what that means, or how it translates into them disliking geralt/witchers. Cats hiss at anything and anyone they perceive to be a threat.</p>
