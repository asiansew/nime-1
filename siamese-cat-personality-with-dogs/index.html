<p>Siamese tends to seek human interaction and they like the companionship of other cats. The breed originally came from thailand (formerly known as siam) in the 14th century, but did not make its appearance in the states until the 19th century. Exotic looking, very affectionate and often, very vocal, the siamese is a very distinct breed of cat that is quite different to the average moggy, something that not all cat lovers are aware of when they first set their sights on. Siamese are active, outgoing cats, so as long as your dogs aren�t aggressive, their personality is quite compatible. The rare flame point siamese cats, by owner accounts, tend to have the best personality traits of the siamese and the red or orange tabby variety of the american shorthair.</p>
