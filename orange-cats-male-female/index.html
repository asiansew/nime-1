<p>Are orange cats always male? We have many female orange tabby cats in my practice. The orange tabby coat color can be your inspiration to choose the perfect cat name for your little kitten. These cats can be long or short haired, and can be male or female, despite the myth that only male felines can be orange, according to sandra toney of petside.com. Orange cats are not a specific breed so there are a variety of breeds that come with an orange coat.</p>

<p>According to researchers at uc berkeley, all orange cats are considered tabbies and about 80 percent of all orange tabbies are male, so the majority of these are male orange cat names. There is no monetary value, per se, associated with a female orange tabby cat. Whether its a male or female, finding the best name for your beloved ginger cat or orange tabby cat can be a really hard task, especially when their name should have something special to say about their unique orange fur or character. Well, it’s not that orange female cats are rare, it is simply that an orange cat is more likely to be a male. Although the research is far from definitive, male cats have been said to be slightly friendlier than female cats, which could explain the loving nature of orange cats.</p>
